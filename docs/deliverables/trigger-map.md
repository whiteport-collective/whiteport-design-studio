# Deliverable: Trigger Map & Personas

**Connect business goals to user psychology - design with insight, not guesswork**

---

## About WDS & the Trigger Map

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**The Trigger Map** bridges strategy and design. It connects what your business wants to achieve with what motivates (and frustrates) your users. This becomes the psychological foundation for every design decision you make.

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Trigger Map is a strategic framework that connects:
- **Business Goals:** What the company wants to achieve
- **User Psychology:** What motivates and frustrates your users
- **Personas:** Detailed profiles of key user groups
- **Feature Priorities:** Which features move the needle on both

**Created by:** Cascade the Strategist  
**When:** Phase 3 - After Product Brief, before design begins  
**Format:** Visual map + detailed persona documents

## Why This Matters

**Without Trigger Mapping:**
- ❌ You guess at user needs based on assumptions
- ❌ Features get prioritized by "coolness" not impact
- ❌ Design feels generic and disconnected
- ❌ No psychological foundation for UX decisions

**With Trigger Mapping:**
- ✅ Design decisions grounded in user psychology
- ✅ Clear feature prioritization based on impact
- ✅ Personas with depth (not demographic stereotypes)
- ✅ Connection between what users need and what business wants

---

## What's Included

### 1. Business Goals
- SMART objectives with measurable targets
- Priority ranking (what matters most?)
- Connection to product strategy

### 2. Driving Forces
- **Positive Forces:** What motivates users (aspirations, gains, desires)
- **Negative Forces:** What frustrates users (pain points, fears, obstacles)
- Emotional and practical triggers for each persona

### 3. Personas
Detailed profiles for each key user group:
- Background & context
- Current situation & pain points
- Goals & aspirations
- Fears & frustrations
- Motivations & values
- Tech savviness & preferences

### 4. Feature Impact Analysis
- How each feature affects persona driving forces
- Impact on business goals
- Priority matrix (High/Medium/Low impact)

### 5. Key Insights
- Strategic recommendations
- Design principles derived from psychology
- "Aha!" moments from the mapping process

## The Dialog with Your Strategy Partner: Cascade the Strategist

**The Process (2-3 hours across multiple sessions):**

Cascade the Strategist guides you through mapping the psychology:

```
Cascade the Strategist: "Let's map the driving forces. Who's your primary user?"

You: "Freelance designers managing client projects."

Cascade the Strategist: "Perfect. What keeps them up at night? What are they afraid of?"

You: "Missing deadlines, looking unprofessional, losing clients because 
      of poor communication."

Cascade the Strategist: "Strong negative forces. Now, what do they aspire to?"

You: "Being seen as organized and reliable. Growing their business. 
      Working with better clients."

Cascade the Strategist: "Excellent! Now, which features address those fears 
                         AND enable those aspirations?"
```

As you work together, Cascade the Strategist creates:
- ✅ Business goal hierarchy
- ✅ Detailed personas with psychology
- ✅ Positive/negative driving forces
- ✅ Feature impact matrix
- ✅ Strategic insights

Then you review together:

```
Cascade the Strategist: "Here's your Trigger Map. Does this capture the psychology?"

You: "Yes! But automated reminders should be higher priority - 
      it hits fear of missing deadlines."

Cascade the Strategist: "Updated! ✅ Trigger Map is complete."
```

**Result:** Trigger Map saved to `/docs/2-trigger-map/`
