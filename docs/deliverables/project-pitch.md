# Deliverable: Project Pitch

**Persuade stakeholders your project is worth the investment - AFTER understanding what they need**

## About WDS & the Project Pitch

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**The Project Pitch** comes after discovery. You've had the conversation. You've asked the questions. You understand what success looks like for them. Now you articulate that understanding in business language that decision-makers recognize as their own needs reflected back with a clear path forward.

**The professional discipline:** The carpenter measures twice before cutting once. The doctor diagnoses before prescribing. You discover before pitching.

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Project Pitch is your persuasive document that:
- Reflects back what they told you they need
- Articulates their desired outcomes in their language
- Demonstrates clear ROI based on their definition of success
- Shows you've understood their pain points and business context
- Presents a thoughtful solution (not a hasty guess)
- Convinces decision-makers to say "yes" because they feel truly understood

**Created by:** Saga the Analyst  
**When:** Phase 1 (Module 03) - AFTER discovery, before you have formal commitment  
**Format:** Markdown document, often converted to PDF/presentation

## Why This Matters

**Without discovery and genuine understanding:**
- ❌ You guess what they need (and guess wrong)
- ❌ Decision-makers feel you're trying to sell them something
- ❌ Projects get stuck in "let me think about it" limbo
- ❌ You can't articulate ROI in terms they care about
- ❌ Stakeholders dismiss it as "nice to have"

**With discovery-driven pitch:**
- ✅ You understand their actual desired outcomes
- ✅ Clear business case using their language and priorities
- ✅ Stakeholders feel heard and understood
- ✅ Decision happens quickly (yes or no) because you're aligned
- ✅ Foundation for healthy collaboration
- ✅ Pitching feels like helping, not selling

## What's Included

- **Their Realization:** Clear statement of what THEY said needs attention (using their evidence)
- **Why It Matters to Them:** Business value in their terms - ROI, cost savings, strategic benefits they mentioned
- **Problem Statement:** Pain points they described experiencing
- **Your Recommended Solution:** Approach based on understanding their needs
- **The Path Forward:** High-level methodology and timeline
- **Investment Required:** Budget, resources, time commitment (justified by their desired outcomes)
- **Success Criteria:** How we'll know if it worked (using their definition of success)
- **Next Steps:** What happens if they say yes

**Key principle:** Every section connects back to what they told you in discovery. You're synthesizing their needs, not inventing them.

## The Dialog with Your Thinking Partner: Saga the Analyst

**The Process (45-60 minutes total):**

**Phase 1: Discovery Preparation (with Saga)**

```
Saga the Analyst: "Before you pitch, you need to understand what they need. 
                   Let's prepare your discovery questions."

You: "I think they have a problem with manual reporting."

Saga the Analyst: "That's your hypothesis. What questions will you ask to 
                   confirm that and understand the real impact?"

You: "I'll ask how much time they spend, what that costs them, 
      what happens when reporting is late..."

Saga the Analyst: "Perfect. Ask until you find the real pain point. 
                   Take detailed notes. And resist the urge to solve 
                   in that first meeting. ✅ Questions ready."
```

**Phase 2: You Conduct Discovery Meeting (20-30 min)**

You meet with the stakeholder, ask questions, listen, take notes, confirm understanding, and say "Let me think about this and come back with a thoughtful proposal."

**Phase 3: Creating the Pitch (with Saga)**

```
Saga the Analyst: "Tell me what you learned in discovery. What did they say?"

You: "Their sales team wastes 10 hours a week on manual reporting. 
      They're frustrated and it's costing $130K/year in lost productivity."

Saga the Analyst: "Excellent - you found the pain point and quantified it. 
                   What does success look like for them?"

You: "Sales reps focus on selling, not spreadsheets. Happier team, 
      better results. They want to see time savings and team morale improve."

Saga the Analyst: "Beautiful. Now I can create a pitch that reflects 
                   their needs back to them..."
```

As you share what you learned, Saga the Analyst creates:
- ✅ Problem statement (using their words)
- ✅ Quantified business value (using their numbers)
- ✅ Vision aligned with their desired outcomes
- ✅ Investment breakdown (justified by their ROI)
- ✅ Success metrics (their definition)

Then you review together:

```
Saga the Analyst: "Here's your pitch. Does this reflect what they told you?"

You: "Yes! But add that their competitors are ahead on automation - 
      they mentioned that three times."

Saga the Analyst: "Added to competitive context. ✅ Pitch is ready for 
                   your presentation meeting."
```

**Result:** Project Pitch that shows you genuinely understood their needs, ready for stakeholder presentation in your second meeting

To start creating your Project Pitch:

```
@saga I need to prepare for a discovery meeting with [Stakeholder Name] 
about [Project Topic]. Help me craft discovery questions.
```

After your discovery meeting:

```
@saga I completed discovery with [Stakeholder Name]. Let me share my notes 
and create the Project Pitch based on what they told me they need.
```

Saga the Analyst will guide you through the entire process - from discovery preparation to final pitch.
