# Deliverable: Component Library & Design Tokens

**Extract reusable patterns - scale your design efficiently across the entire product**

## About WDS & the Design System

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**The Design System** is where consistency becomes effortless. After specifying your initial pages, Freya the UX Designer helps you identify reusable patterns and extract them into a structured component library. This becomes the foundation for rapid, consistent design and development.

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Design System documents all reusable components, patterns, and design tokens:
- Component specifications (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Interaction patterns
- Accessibility guidelines
- Component usage rules

**Created by:** Freya the UX Designer (extraction from page specs)  
**When:** Phase 6 - After initial page specifications are complete  
**Format:** Structured component library documentation

## Why This Matters

**Without a Design System:**
- ❌ Every page/screen designed from scratch
- ❌ Inconsistent UI across product
- ❌ Developers reinvent components repeatedly
- ❌ No single source of truth
- ❌ Design debt accumulates fast

**With a Design System:**
- ✅ Rapid design and development
- ✅ Consistent user experience
- ✅ Easier maintenance and updates
- ✅ Onboarding new designers/developers faster
- ✅ Scalable design operations

---

## What's Included

### 1. Design Tokens
- **Colors:** Brand palette, semantic colors, state colors
- **Typography:** Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Spacing:** Consistent spacing scale
- **Shadows:** Elevation system
- **Border Radius:** Rounding scale
- **Breakpoints:** Responsive design breakpoints

### 2. Component Library
For each component:
- Component name and Object ID pattern
- Visual examples and variants
- States (default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading)
- Content structure
- Usage guidelines
- Accessibility requirements
- Code examples (if applicable)

### 3. Patterns
- Navigation patterns
- Form patterns
- Layout patterns
- Interaction patterns
- Empty states
- Error states
- Loading states

### 4. Guidelines
- When to use each component
- Accessibility standards (WCAG compliance)
- Mobile vs desktop considerations
- Brand guidelines integration

## The Dialog with Your Design Partner: Freya the UX Designer

**The Process (2-3 hours):**

Freya the UX Designer helps you extract patterns from your page specs:

```
Freya the UX Designer: "I've analyzed your page specifications. I found 8 button 
                         variants across 5 pages. Let's standardize them."

You: "Yes! Primary, secondary, and text buttons are intentional. 
      The others are inconsistent."

Freya the UX Designer: "Perfect! I'll document those 3 as your button system. 
                         What about colors?"

You: "Brand blue #2563EB for primary actions, gray for secondary, 
      red for destructive actions."

Freya the UX Designer: "Got it. I see you're using 3 different card components. 
                         Are those variants of one pattern or separate components?"

You: "They're all the same - just different content inside."

Freya the UX Designer: "Excellent - I'll document one card component with content slots..."
```

As you work together, Freya the UX Designer creates:
- ✅ Design token system
- ✅ Component specifications
- ✅ Usage guidelines
- ✅ Accessibility standards
- ✅ Pattern library

Then you review together:

```
Freya the UX Designer: "Here's your Design System. Does this cover your needs?"

You: "Add a 'ghost button' variant for low-emphasis actions."

Freya the UX Designer: "Added COMP_BUTTON_GHOST to button variants. ✅ System is complete."
```

**Result:** Design System saved to `/docs/5-design-system/`

To start creating your Design System:

```
@freya Let's extract a Design System from my page specifications.
```

Freya the UX Designer will analyze your existing specs and guide the extraction process.
