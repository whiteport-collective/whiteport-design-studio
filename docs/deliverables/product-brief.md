# Deliverable: Product Brief

**Crystal-clear strategic foundation that guides every design decision**

---

## About WDS & the Product brief

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**The Product Brief** is your first strategic deliverable in the WDS workflow. After you've secured stakeholder commitment (Pitch & Service Agreement), this document defines **what you're building and why it matters**. Everything that follows - from trigger mapping to final specifications - builds on this foundation.

Think of it as your project's constitution: the strategic reference point that keeps everyone aligned as the project evolves.

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Product Brief is your project's north star - a comprehensive document that defines:
- What you're building and why it matters
- Who it's for and what problems it solves
- How success will be measured
- Strategic positioning and competitive landscape
- Technical and business constraints

**Created by:** Saga the WDS Analyst Agent  
**When:** Phase 2 (Module 04) - After alignment, before design work begins  
**Format:** Structured markdown document

## Why This Matters

**Without a solid Product Brief:**
- ❌ Teams build features nobody asked for
- ❌ Scope creep becomes unmanageable
- ❌ Design decisions based on personal preference, not strategy
- ❌ You can't evaluate trade-offs ("Should we add this feature?")

**With a Product Brief:**
- ✅ Every design decision has clear rationale
- ✅ Team alignment on priorities
- ✅ Ability to say "no" to scope creep
- ✅ Confidence that you're building the right thing

## The Dialog with Your Thinking Partner: Saga the Analyst

**The Process (30-45 minutes):**

Saga the Analyst guides you through defining your product with strategic questions:

```
Saga the Analyst: "Let's start with the vision. In one sentence, 
                   what transformation are you creating for users?"

You: "We're helping small teams manage their projects without 
      the complexity of enterprise tools."

Saga the Analyst: "Perfect! That's clear. Now, who specifically is this for?"

You: "Remote teams of 3-10 people - freelancers, startups, small agencies."

Saga the Analyst: "Got it. Who is this NOT for?"

You: "Large enterprises with complex approval workflows - 
      they need something different."

Saga the Analyst: "Great clarity! Let's talk about core features..."
```

As you talk, Saga the Analyst creates:
- ✅ Vision statement
- ✅ Target users (who it's for, who it's NOT for)
- ✅ Core features (prioritized)
- ✅ Success criteria (SMART objectives)
- ✅ Competitive landscape
- ✅ Constraints

Then you review together:

```
Saga the Analyst: "Here's your Product Brief. Does this capture your vision?"

You: "Yes! But add 'time tracking' to must-haves."

Saga the Analyst: "Updated! ✅ Brief is ready."
```

**Result:** Product Brief saved to `/docs/1-project-brief/01-product-brief.md`
