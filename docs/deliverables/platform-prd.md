# Deliverable: Platform PRD & Architecture

**Define the technical foundation - bridge design vision with technical reality**

---

## About WDS & the Platform PRD

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**The Platform PRD** ensures your design vision is technically feasible. Idunn the Technical Architect helps you define the technical foundation before UX design begins, preventing costly rework when beautiful designs meet harsh technical reality.

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Platform PRD (Product Requirements Document) defines the technical architecture and infrastructure decisions:
- Data models and database structure
- System architecture and tech stack
- APIs and integrations
- Security and performance requirements
- Technical constraints and decisions

**Created by:** Idunn the Technical Architect  
**When:** Phase 4 - After Trigger Map, before UX design (or in parallel)  
**Format:** Structured PRD document + architecture diagrams

---

## Why This Matters

**Without Platform Architecture:**
- ❌ Designers create UX that's technically impossible
- ❌ Developers make inconsistent tech decisions
- ❌ Costly rework when design meets reality
- ❌ Security and performance as afterthoughts

**With Platform Architecture:**
- ✅ Realistic design constraints from day one
- ✅ Technical decisions documented and justified
- ✅ Developers aligned on approach
- ✅ Foundation for sustainable growth

## The Dialog with Your Technical Partner: Idunn the Technical Architect

**The Process (1-2 hours):**

Idunn the Technical Architect helps you define technical boundaries:

```
Idunn the Technical Architect: "Let's establish the foundation. What platform 
                                are you targeting?"

You: "WordPress site with custom blocks for the design system."

Idunn the Technical Architect: "Smart choice - familiar editing, structured output. 
                                Any third-party integrations?"

You: "Newsletter signup (Mailchimp), analytics (Google Analytics)."

Idunn the Technical Architect: "Got it. What about user authentication?"

You: "No login needed - it's a marketing site."

Idunn the Technical Architect: "Perfect - that simplifies architecture significantly. 
                                Let me document this..."
```

As you discuss, Idunn the Technical Architect creates:
- ✅ Technology stack decisions
- ✅ Data model (if needed)
- ✅ Integration requirements
- ✅ Performance targets
- ✅ Security considerations
- ✅ Technical constraints for design

Then you review together:

```
Idunn the Technical Architect: "Here's your Platform PRD. Does this match your needs?"

You: "Add mobile-first responsive requirement."

Idunn the Technical Architect: "Added to technical requirements. ✅ PRD is ready."
```

**Result:** Platform PRD ready to guide UX design and development

## Agent Activation

To start creating your Platform PRD:

```
@idunn I need to create a Platform PRD for [Your Project Name].
```

Idunn the Technical Architect will begin the conversation and guide you through the process.
