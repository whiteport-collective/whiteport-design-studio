# Deliverable: Page Specifications & Prototypes

**Turn sketches into complete specs - capture WHAT it looks like AND WHY you designed it that way**

## About WDS & Page Specifications

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**Page Specifications** are where your design thinking becomes implementation-ready. Instead of handing off a Figma file with vague annotations, you create detailed specs that capture content, structure, strategy, and rationale—specifications that developers AND AI agents can execute with precision.

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

Page Specifications are detailed documentation for each page/screen in your product:
- Complete content with language tags
- Component descriptions with Object IDs
- Navigation and user flows
- Strategic rationale for design decisions
- Interactive prototypes (optional)

**Created by:** Freya the UX Designer  
**When:** Phase 5 - After Platform PRD (or in parallel)  
**Format:** Markdown specifications + sketches/prototypes

## Why This Matters

**Without Detailed Specifications:**
- ❌ Developers guess at your intent
- ❌ Content gets "lorem ipsum" treatment
- ❌ Design decisions lost in handoff
- ❌ Endless "what did you mean?" meetings

**With Page Specifications:**
- ✅ Preserves design intent from concept to code
- ✅ Developers understand the WHY, not just the WHAT
- ✅ Content is strategic, not placeholder
- ✅ Specifications become AI-ready super-prompts
- ✅ Reduces implementation errors and rework

## The Dialog with Your Design Partner: Freya the UX Designer

**The Process (iterative, per page):**

Freya the UX Designer helps you specify each page with precision:

```
Freya the UX Designer: "I see you've uploaded a sketch. Let me analyze it... 
                         This looks like a dashboard homepage. Is that right?"

You: "Yes! It's the first thing users see after login."

Freya the UX Designer: "Perfect. What's the user's situation when they arrive here?"

You: "They just logged in - they want to see their project status at a glance."

Freya the UX Designer: "Got it. I can see three sections in your sketch: 
                         header navigation, project cards, and quick actions. 
                         Let me identify the components..."

You: "The project cards need to show status, deadline, and team members."

Freya the UX Designer: "Excellent detail! Let me document that with Object IDs..."
```

As you work together, Freya the UX Designer creates:
- ✅ Complete navigation structure
- ✅ Page overview with context
- ✅ Section breakdown with Object IDs
- ✅ Content with language tags
- ✅ Component specifications
- ✅ Object Registry

Then you review together:

```
Freya the UX Designer: "Here's your page specification. Does this capture your vision?"

You: "Add a filter dropdown to the quick actions section."

Freya the UX Designer: "Added COMP_FILTER_001 to quick actions. ✅ Spec is complete."
```

**Result:** Page specification saved to `/docs/4-scenarios/[page-name]/`

## Example

See the [WDS Presentation Project - Page Specification](../../examples/WDS-Presentation/docs/4-scenarios/1.1-wds-presentation/1.1-wds-presentation.md)

---

## Agent Activation

To start creating Page Specifications:

```
@freya I have a sketch for [Page Name] - let's create the specification.
```

Or simply upload a sketch image to any agent, and they'll recognize it and activate Freya automatically.
