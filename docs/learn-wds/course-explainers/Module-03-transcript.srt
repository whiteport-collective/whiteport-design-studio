00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,151
Welcome to The Explainer. Today we're

2
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:04,333
going to tackle something that makes a

3
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:05,892
lot of creative people really

4
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:08,074
uncomfortable, and we're going to turn it

5
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,633
into your single greatest professional

6
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,504
strength, mastering the business side of

7
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:13,686
design. I'm willing to bet this sounds

8
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,869
familiar, right? You know that pit in

9
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:18,363
your stomach when it's time to talk money

10
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:21,009
or contracts or negotiations?All you want

11
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:23,914
to do is just get to the fun part,

12
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:26,174
the creative work. But here's a thought.

13
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:28,434
What if all that business stuff isn't

14
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:30,694
just a necessary evil? What if it's

15
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:32,631
actually the secret ingredient to doing

16
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,246
better, more successful design work?

17
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:36,829
Let's dive in and reframe this using the

18
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,766
Whiteboard Design Studio method as our

19
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:41,553
guide. OK, First things first. We have to

20
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:43,479
talk about the core problem, the

21
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,725
fundamental dilemma that trips us so many

22
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,972
projects before a single idea is even

23
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:50,219
sketched out. And here's the deal. You

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,824
could create the most jaw-dropping,

25
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:54,071
brilliant design in the world, but if

26
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,317
it's built on a shaky foundation of

27
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:58,243
mismatched expectations, it is going to

28
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:00,490
fail. The groundwork you lay before you.

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,216
Ever open a design A often matters more

30
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:06,160
than the design itself. O how do we fix

31
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,122
this? Well, what's really fascinating is

32
00:01:08,122 --> 00:01:10,084
that the solution isn't some complex

33
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,047
business secret. It's a simple, powerful

34
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:14,663
shift in your mindset. I mean, just think

35
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:16,625
about any other respected profession. A

36
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,588
good Carpenter always measures twice, so

37
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:21,422
they only have to cut once. It's all

38
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:23,168
about that upfront discipline to make

39
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,787
sure the work is right. Or think about a

40
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:27,825
doctor. They're not just going to guess

41
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:29,571
what's wrong and start handing out

42
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:31,608
prescriptions, right? No way. They ask a

43
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,645
ton of questions, they run tests, they

44
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:35,391
diagnose the root problem before they

45
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:37,429
ever propose a solution, and our process

46
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,466
should be exactly the same. So this

47
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,181
brings us to the. Absolute core of this

48
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,858
whole approach. Understand before you

49
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:45,870
solve. It's about having the discipline

50
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,553
to resist that urge we all have to

51
00:01:48,553 --> 00:01:51,235
jump in and show off our ideas. Instead,

52
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,918
your only job in that first meeting is

53
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:55,930
to listen to deeply understand their

54
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,607
goals, their frustrations, and what

55
00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:59,954
success actually looks like to them. And

56
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,274
this charge is. Lays it out perfectly,

57
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:04,451
doesn't it? The amateur rushes in, trying

58
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,940
to sell a solution to impress with speed.

59
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,806
The professional, on the other hand,

60
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:10,983
slows down. They help the client get

61
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:12,850
crystal clear on the problem. First,

62
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,716
they're not selling, they're helping. And

63
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,582
listen, this isn't just for freelancers.

64
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:18,760
It doesn't matter if you're a consultant

65
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,937
pitching a new client, a business owner

66
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:23,311
hiring a vendor. Or an employee trying to

67
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,272
get buy in from your boss. Anytime

68
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:27,513
there's a gap between you and a decision

69
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,474
maker who needs to commit resources, this

70
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,995
is the mindset you need. OK, so we've got

71
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:33,956
the mindset down. Now for the practical

72
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:35,917
part. Let's look at the actual toolkit

73
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,438
that helps you build a pitch so clear and

74
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,679
so aligned that it makes it really easy

75
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,427
for them to say yes. These six questions

76
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:44,990
are everything. Every single successful

77
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,177
proposal, whether it's for a client or

78
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,677
your boss, has to answer all of them.

79
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:52,177
What are we building? Why? What's in the

80
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:54,677
box? How will we do it? What's the

81
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,865
investment and what's the next step? Miss

82
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:59,052
even 1 and you're creating doubt, and

83
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:01,552
doubt is a deal killer. This is so

84
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:03,876
important to remember. You have to speak

85
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:05,396
their language. Decision makers don't

86
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:07,220
really care about how beautiful your

87
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,348
design is, they care about the outcome.

88
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:12,084
Is it worth the time and money you have

89
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:13,908
to connect every single thing you're

90
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:16,036
proposing back to the business value they

91
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:18,772
told you they needed. O don't just say a

92
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:21,204
new tool will save time. Quantify it. Put

93
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:23,850
a number on it. Saying this project

94
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,800
will create $150,000 in annual

95
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,140
productivity gains. Now that is a

96
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,090
language every single decision maker

97
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,040
understands. And here's the beautiful

98
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,770
part. Once you get that solid alignment

99
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,500
on the value and the plan, everything

100
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,230
that comes next just flows. It becomes

101
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,180
this totally natural, simple progression

102
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,399
from understanding. To agreement. You can

103
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:47,096
see it here. It's like a logical chain

104
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,456
reaction. You listen, you build a itch

105
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:52,153
based on what you heard, they accept it.

106
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:54,514
And then that very same document becomes

107
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,874
the foundation for the contract and the

108
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:58,560
project brief. No surprises, no

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,583
confusion. Each step builds directly on

110
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,943
the last. And let's talk about that

111
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,718
contract. Because it makes people

112
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,710
nervous. A contract isn't about mistrust.

113
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,033
It's an act of professional service. It's

114
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,693
just about clarity. You're simply

115
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,685
formalizing what you both already happily

116
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,341
agreed to. And you know what the most

117
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:17,001
important section is often defining

118
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:19,324
what's out of scope. That's your best

119
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:21,316
friend in preventing scope creep. So

120
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,640
you've put in all this upfront work.

121
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,446
You've listened, you've diagnosed, you've

122
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:27,444
aligned. What's the ultimate payoff? Why

123
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:29,776
go through all the trouble? Well, the

124
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:31,775
impact is huge. It completely transforms

125
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,107
the entire relationship. Client

126
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,439
confidence in you goes through the roof.

127
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,438
The chances of the project actually

128
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:39,436
succeeding skyrocket. And for you, it

129
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,435
leads to a healthier, more profitable

130
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:44,100
business. It really is a win, win, win.

131
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,192
And this might be the biggest shift of

132
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,781
all. You've fundamentally change your

133
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:51,005
role. You're no longer just an order

134
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,229
taker, someone who just executes a list

135
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,453
of tasks. You become a strategic partner,

136
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:58,313
someone they rely on to guide them to a

137
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:00,219
successful outcome. The whole thing, from

138
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:02,126
that first conversation to the final

139
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:04,032
signed contract, is really an active

140
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:06,606
service. You were giving your client and

141
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,702
yourself the gift of clarity. It makes

142
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:11,097
everyone feel safe and secure so you can

143
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:13,193
all focus on what really matters, doing

144
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:14,989
incredible work together. And that leaves

145
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:17,384
us with one final thought to take into

146
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,480
your next meeting. Ask yourself this, are

147
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,875
you there just to sell them something or

148
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,971
are you there to genuinely help them

149
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:24,270
succeed?
