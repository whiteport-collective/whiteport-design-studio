**IMPORTANT: Use the reference image as your exact style guide. Match all visual elements, colors, layout, and character design.**

Create a 1920x1080px YouTube thumbnail matching the reference image style.

**What to Change from Reference:**

**Headlines (Left side):**
- Line 1: "INSTANT CLARITY" (Rubrik Light, 91pt, white)
- Line 2: "A PRODUCT BRIEF" (Rubrik Bold, 91pt, white)
- Line 3: "IN 30 QUESTIONS!" (Rubrik Bold, 91pt, white)
- Line spacing: 79pt

**Module Badge (Bottom-left):**
- "04 Product Brief" (Rubrik Regular, 108pt, white on red #ff1744)

**Character Activity:**
- Keep the woman's angle and position similar as in the first reference image. Keep the character neutral and stylized as it is
- Woman is working at her desk with a large product brief document/blueprint spread out in front of her
- She's holding a pen/marker and has just finished writing, looking satisfied at the completed document
- On the desk: sticky notes, coffee cup, the product brief with visible sections/structure
- Skip the tablet

**Background Pattern:**
- Clear the background from previous objects except the globe
- Add oversized and toned down strategic elements (checkmarks, document icons, organizational charts, flowchart nodes)
- Keep as in reference image

**Workspace Props:**
- Add: stylized product brief document (visible structure/sections), sticky notes, pen/marker, coffee cup, notebook. No text should be visible or be presented with just scribble or gray markers

**Keep Everything Else from Reference:**
- do not put light objects behind her face since we need to keep her silhouette clear
- Top-right branding text
- Character design and style
- Color scheme and layout
