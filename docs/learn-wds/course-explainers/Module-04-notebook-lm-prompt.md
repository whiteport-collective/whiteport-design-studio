## Prompt

Create an engaging 25-30 minute podcast conversation between two hosts discussing Module 04 of the Whiteport Design Studio (WDS) course: Product Brief.

**IMPORTANT: WDS stands for Whiteport Design Studio - always refer to it by its full name "Whiteport Design Studio" or "WDS" throughout the conversation.**

**Host 1 (The Curious Designer):** A designer ready to start a project and wants to understand the practical process.

**Host 2 (The Practical Guide):** A designer who uses the Product Brief as a living reference throughout every project phase.

**Conversation structure:**

### 1. Opening (3 min) - The Real Question

The Curious Designer: "I already know what app I want to build. Why should I waste time on a document?"

The Practical Guide: "That's exactly what everyone thinks. But here's what you're actually missing: You're about to spend weeks or months prompting AI, fighting hallucinations, correcting assumptions, copy-pasting between tools. The Product Brief isn't a document - it's the most powerful prompt you'll ever create. And it makes your idea better."

The Curious Designer: "Wait, a prompt? I thought it was planning documentation."

The Practical Guide: "That's the paradigm shift. In WDS, the Product Brief IS your prompt - but it's a prompt that every agent reads automatically. You write it once through a guided conversation, and it stops AI hallucinations before they start. No more endless back-and-forth. No more 'but I already told you that.' The AI just knows your project."

### 2. One Environment, Zero Copy-Paste (4 min)

The Curious Designer: "OK, but where does this actually happen? Am I jumping between ChatGPT and my code editor?"

The Practical Guide: "No! That's the breakthrough. Everything happens in your IDE - your code editor. You create the Product Brief there. You refine it there. Every agent reads it there. Your code lives there. Your documentation lives there. Everything in one place.

No cutting and pasting between GPTs. No losing context. No 'wait, where did I save that?' It's all right there, version controlled, accessible to your entire team, ready for every phase of development."

The Curious Designer: "So I'm not switching tools constantly?"

The Practical Guide: "Never. You activate Saga in your IDE. She asks questions. You answer. The document builds right there in your editor. Then when you move to design, Sketch reads that same document - same place, same context. When you write content, Lyra reads it. When you code, developers read it. One environment, one source of truth, zero friction."

### 3. Questions That Make Your Idea Better (6 min)

The Curious Designer: "You said this makes my idea better. How?"

The Practical Guide: "The process is around 30 questions where your answer leads to the next in a fun and engaging way. This challenges you to really think deeply about your product. Not surface-level stuff - deep strategic thinking. And I guarantee - you will feel MORE excited about your idea when you're done, not less.

Saga asks things like: 'What problem are you actually solving?' You think you know, but when you have to articulate it clearly, you realize there's a deeper insight.

Then she digs deeper: 'Who is experiencing this problem?' Not just 'parents' but 'working parents juggling multiple kids' schedules while managing their own careers.' The specificity makes your solution sharper.

She asks: 'How will you measure success?' You can't say 'make it better' - you have to think: 'Reduce missed commitments by 50% in month one.' That clarity changes how you design.

She explores constraints: 'What's your budget? Timeline? Team size? Technical limitations?' Naming them isn't limiting - it's liberating. Now you know what you're working with.

And she keeps going - about your competitive landscape, your differentiation, your stakeholders, your risks. Around 30 questions total that cover everything you need to think through before you start building."

The Curious Designer: "So it's not just documentation, it's thinking?"

The Practical Guide: "Exactly! You're refining your thinking in real-time. And here's the beautiful part - you're watching the document build as you talk. Every insight captured. Every refinement documented. And when your thinking evolves later - which it will - the document is right there at your fingertips. You update it immediately, and every agent sees the improved thinking instantly."

### 4. Man and Machine Collaboration (5 min)

The Curious Designer: "Wait, so Saga is writing the document while I talk. Can I see what she's doing?"

The Practical Guide: "Yes! And this is crucial. You review every single change the AI makes. You're not blindly accepting AI output. You're collaborating.

Saga suggests a way to phrase your vision. You see it appear in the document. You think: 'Hmm, not quite right.' You say: 'Actually, let me refine that...' She updates it immediately.

This is powerful man-and-machine collaboration. You bring the strategic thinking. She brings the structure and ensures nothing gets missed. But you're always in control. You see every change. You approve every word. You refine together."

The Curious Designer: "So I'm not just prompting and hoping?"

The Practical Guide: "Never. You're working together in real-time. And because it's all in your IDE with version control, you can see the entire history. You can revert changes. You can branch and experiment. It's not black-box AI - it's transparent collaboration where you're always the decision maker."

### 5. Beyond the Brief - The Complete Foundation (4 min)

The Curious Designer: "Is the Product Brief the only document I create?"

The Practical Guide: "No! And this is where it gets even better. Saga will also set up additional documents in the same folder - right alongside your Product Brief.

Need to define your main features? She creates a Core Features document.

Need to specify supported languages? She creates a Language Selection document.

Need to define your brand voice? She creates a Tone of Voice document.

Need to capture your visual identity? She creates a Visual Design Brief.

Whatever is crucial for YOUR project, she sets it up in the same place. Not scattered across tools. Not lost in chat history. Right there in `/docs/A-Product-Brief/` - organized, accessible, version controlled."

The Curious Designer: "So it's not just one document, it's a complete strategic foundation?"

The Practical Guide: "Exactly. And every document feeds into the next phase of your project. Your Product Brief leads to Trigger Mapping. Your Core Features lead to Scenarios. Your Tone of Voice leads to Content. Everything connects. Nothing is wasted."

### 6. Stopping Hallucinations Before They Start (4 min)

The Curious Designer: "You mentioned this stops AI hallucinations. How?"

The Practical Guide: "Because every document in WDS leads to the next. The Product Brief becomes the foundation for Trigger Mapping. Trigger Mapping becomes the foundation for Scenarios. Scenarios become the foundation for Design.

Each agent reads the previous work before starting. They don't make assumptions. They don't hallucinate features you never asked for. They don't invent user needs that don't exist.

Without this foundation, you're constantly fighting: 'No, I didn't say that.' 'Why did you add this feature?' 'That's not my target user.' You're prompting forever just to get back to what you actually wanted.

With the Product Brief, the AI knows your project from the start. Every agent is aligned. Every decision is grounded in your documented strategy. The hallucinations just... stop."

The Curious Designer: "So I'm not constantly correcting the AI?"

The Practical Guide: "No. You're collaborating from a shared understanding. The AI isn't guessing - it's reading your Product Brief. It knows your constraints, your users, your goals. You spend your time refining and improving, not correcting and explaining."

---

### 7. The Bottom Line (3 min)

The Curious Designer: "OK, I'm convinced. What's the actual time investment?"

The Practical Guide: "Maybe 2-3 hours for a thorough Product Brief. But here's what you're getting:

You're creating the most powerful prompt possible - one that every agent reads automatically.

You're stopping weeks of hallucination hell and endless prompting.

You're setting up one environment where everything lives - no tool switching, no copy-paste.

You're establishing transparent collaboration where you review every AI change.

You're refining your thinking through questions that make your idea genuinely better.

You're creating a living document that's always at your fingertips when your thinking evolves.

You're building a complete strategic foundation with all supporting documents in one place.

And you're supercharging your entire process - making the final product better than your original idea.

That's not time wasted. That's time invested that pays back 10x, 50x, 100x throughout your project."

The Curious Designer: "When you put it that way... why would I NOT do this?"

The Practical Guide: "Exactly. Open your IDE. Activate Saga. Start the conversation. Your future self - the one who isn't fighting hallucinations at 2am - will thank you."
