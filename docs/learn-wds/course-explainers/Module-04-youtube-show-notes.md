Module 04 - Product Brief - Your Strategic Foundation Through Guided Conversation

<https://youtu.be/yhKxkuLq1kQ>

Teams waste weeks building the wrong thing beautifully. The Product Brief prevents this - a 2-3 page strategic document that answers the 5 questions every project needs before design starts. Create it through AI-guided conversation with Saga, your thinking partner.

*You'll learn:*
✅ Why projects fail without strategic foundation (and how to prevent it)
✅ The 5 strategic questions every Product Brief must answer
✅ What the document looks like and how teams use it
✅ How WDS ensures excellence through thinking partnership
✅ Additional strategic documents you can create as needed

*Free & open-source* | 46-58 minutes | Foundation module
