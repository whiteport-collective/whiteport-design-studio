# Lesson 6: Workshop 4 - Prioritization

**Rank What Matters Most**

---

## Overview

Workshop 4 is where you make strategic choices about what matters most. You'll rank your target groups and their psychological drivers to create clear priorities that guide all design decisions.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Format:** Conversational with Saga  
**Output:** Ranked target groups + ranked drivers for each group

---

## What You'll Do

### 1. Prioritize Target Groups

**Rank your personas by strategic value:**
- Which groups have highest business impact?
- Which are most feasible to serve?
- Rank 1-N based on strategic importance

**This ranking determines** which groups get design focus first.

### 2. Prioritize Driving Forces

**For each group, rank their psychological drivers:**
- Within each persona, which drivers are strongest?
- Which have most emotional intensity?
- Which would drive the most urgent action?
- Rank by power to drive behavior

**This ranking determines** which drivers become your feature scoring criteria.

## Key Questions Saga Asks

### For Target Groups

- "Which target group will have the biggest impact on your top business goal?"
- "Which group is most feasible to reach and serve effectively?"
- "How would you rank all groups from highest to lowest strategic value?"
- "Why does this group rank higher than the others?"
- "What makes this group more strategic?"

### For Driving Forces

- "For [top persona], which driving forces are most powerful?"
- "Which drivers have the most emotional intensity?"
- "Which pain points cause the most urgent need to act?"
- "Which positive drivers are strongest motivators?"
- "How would you rank these drivers by their power to drive behavior?"

## Generic Example

### Target Group Rankings

**1. Remote Team Leads** (Priority #1)
- **Why #1:** High impact (each brings 5-10 users), reachable through professional channels, urgent pain (team burnout risk), budget authority
- **Business impact:** Directly drives user acquisition and retention goals
- **Feasibility:** Can reach through LinkedIn, management communities

**2. Solo Remote Workers** (Priority #2)
- **Why #2:** Large market size, moderate impact per user, chronic pain (less urgent than team leads)
- **Business impact:** Volume play, good retention potential
- **Feasibility:** Reachable through remote work communities

**3. Remote Executives** (Priority #3)
- **Why #3:** High value per user, but harder to reach, longer sales cycles
- **Business impact:** Strategic accounts, high revenue potential
- **Feasibility:** Difficult to reach, requires different approach

### Driving Force Rankings: Remote Team Lead

**Top 5 Prioritized Drivers:**

**1. Fear of team burnout without noticing** (NEGATIVE)
- **Why #1:** Most urgent, highest emotional intensity, constant worry
- **Emotional core:** Guilt and responsibility for people's wellbeing
- **Urgency:** Very high (active problem)
- **Impact:** Directly threatens their success

**2. Want to demonstrate effective leadership** (POSITIVE)

- **Impact:** Damages team and reputation

**4. Want to build strong team culture** (POSITIVE)
- **Why #4:** Aspirational, important but less urgent
- **Emotional core:** Pride in team cohesion
- **Urgency:** Medium (long-term goal)

## Prioritization Criteria

### For Target Groups

**Business Impact:**
- Which group's behavior most directly drives objectives?
- Which group has power to make goals happen?
- What's the multiplier effect? (e.g., team leads bring teams)

**Feasibility:**
- Can we actually reach this group?
- Do we have channels to communicate?
- Can we serve them with our resources?
- Is market size sufficient?

**Urgency of Pain:**
- How urgent is their problem?
- Are they actively seeking solutions?
- What's the cost of not solving?

**Strategic Fit:**
- Does this align with company strengths?
- Is this a sustainable advantage?
- Does this open future opportunities?

### For Driving Forces

**Emotional Intensity:**
- How strongly do they feel this?
- Does this keep them up at night?
- Is this a constant worry or occasional concern?

**Urgency:**
- How immediate is the need?
- What triggers action on this?
- Is this active pain or chronic discomfort?

**Impact on Behavior:**
- Would solving this drive adoption?
- Would this prevent churn?
- Does this create word-of-mouth?

**Measurability:**
- Can we tell if we've addressed this?
- Can users articulate this need?
- Is there observable behavior change?

## Why Prioritization Matters

### Without Prioritization

**Problems:**
- Try to serve everyone equally (serve no one well)
- Build features that address minor drivers
- Waste resources on low-impact groups
- No clear focus for design

**Result:** Mediocre product that doesn't deeply solve anyone's problems.

### With Prioritization

**Benefits:**
- Focus design on highest-impact groups
- Address most powerful psychological drivers
- Allocate resources strategically
- Create deep value for top segments

**Result:** Product that deeply solves urgent problems for strategic users.

---

## The Prioritization Cascade

Once you have rankings, design decisions become clear:

```
Top Business Goal
    ↓
Top Target Group (who can best achieve this?)
    ↓
Top Psychological Driver (what drives them most?)
    ↓
Features that address this driver
```

**Example:**
- **Goal:** Increase user retention to 70%
- **Top Group:** Remote Team Leads (high retention potential)
- **Top Driver:** Fear of team burnout without noticing
- **Top Feature:** Daily team pulse check with burnout indicators
- **Why:** Addresses their #1 fear, drives retention

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Everything Is Priority #1

**Problem:** "All groups are equally important"  
**Why it fails:** Dilutes focus, serves no one well  
**Fix:** Make hard choices, rank ruthlessly

### Mistake 2: Prioritizing by Ease

**Problem:** "Let's focus on the easiest group first"  
**Why it fails:** May not drive business goals  
**Fix:** Balance impact with feasibility

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Emotional Intensity

**Problem:** Ranking drivers by logic, not emotion  
**Why it fails:** Miss what actually drives behavior  
**Fix:** Consider emotional intensity and urgency

### Mistake 4: Too Many Top Priorities

**Problem:** "Top 10 drivers are all critical"  
**Why it fails:** Can't focus, spreads resources thin  
**Fix:** Limit to top 5-7 drivers for scoring

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Business Goals

**Problem:** Prioritizing based on interesting psychology  
**Why it fails:** Doesn't connect to business success  
**Fix:** Always trace back to business objectives

---

## How This Feeds Into Workshop 5

**Workshop 4 creates the scoring criteria:**

```
Business Goals
    ↓
Target Groups (ranked)
    ↓
Driving Forces (ranked for each group)
    ↓
Top 5-7 Drivers (scoring criteria)
    ↓
Workshop 5: Score features against these drivers
```

The top-ranked drivers become the columns in your feature scoring matrix.

---

## Tips for Success

**DO:**
- ✅ Make hard choices (not everything is #1)
- ✅ Consider both impact and feasibility
- ✅ Focus on emotional intensity
- ✅ Limit to top 5-7 drivers for scoring
- ✅ Trace priorities back to business goals

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Avoid making choices
- ❌ Prioritize by ease alone
- ❌ Ignore emotional intensity
- ❌ Create too many "top" priorities
- ❌ Forget the business objectives

---

## What's Next

Workshop 5 uses these priorities to systematically score features. Each feature gets rated against your top-ranked drivers, creating a data-driven roadmap.

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Ruthless prioritization** - Not everything can be #1  
✅ **Two levels of ranking** - Groups first, then drivers  
✅ **Strategic criteria** - Impact + feasibility + urgency  
✅ **Top 5-7 drivers** - Become feature scoring criteria  
✅ **Clear focus** - Guides all design decisions
