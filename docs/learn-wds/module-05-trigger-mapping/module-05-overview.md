**Time:** 8-10 minutes

Rank what matters most:

- Prioritizing target groups by strategic value
- Prioritizing drivers by emotional intensity
- The prioritization cascade
- Creating focus for design efforts
- Foundation for feature scoring

### [Lesson 8: Workshop 5 - Feature Impact](lesson-08-workshop-5-feature-impact.md)

**Time:** 10-12 minutes

Score features by strategic impact:

- Systematic scoring (0-3 scale)
- Rating features against prioritized drivers
- Calculating total impact scores
- Creating data-driven roadmap

**What you'll learn:**ategic one-page document:

- What the Trigger Map looks like
- How to read and use it
- Why it stays relevant as features evolve
- How teams use it for alignment
- When to update it (and when not to)

### [Lesson 11: Feature Impact Scoring](lesson-11-feature-impact-scoring.md)

**Time:** 9-11 minutes

Deep dive into systematic feature prioritization:

- How the scoring system works in detail
- Rating features against prioritized drivers
- Calculating total impact scores
- Creating your ranked feature list
- Making data-driven design decisions

## Tutorials

### [Tutorial 05: Create Your Trigger Map](tutorial-05.md)

**Full Trigger Mapping Process (Starting from Scratch)**

Step-by-step hands-on guide to creating your complete Trigger Map with Saga through all 5 workshops.

**Time:** 60-90 minutes  
**What you'll create:** Complete Trigger Map + scored feature list  
**Best for:** Major products, multiple user groups, comprehensive strategy, no existing documentation

---

### [Tutorial 05B: Create Your Value Trigger Chain](tutorial-05b-value-trigger-chain.md)

**Lightweight Alternative (Quick Validation)**

Quick strategic validation for focused user journeys - streamlined single-workshop approach.

**Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**What you'll create:** Single-chain map from goal to trigger  
**Best for:** Smaller features, single journey, quick validation, time-constrained situations

---

### [Tutorial 05C: Synthesize from Documentation](tutorial-05c-documentation-synthesis.md)

**Documentation Synthesis (Existing Research)**

Transform existing documentation into an actionable Trigger Map - validate and organize what you already have.

**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**What you'll create:** Synthesized Trigger Map + gap analysis  
**Best for:** Extensive vision docs, user research, plans, or interviews that need to be made actionable

**Which tutorial should you use?** See [Lesson 2: Heritage & Evolution](lesson-02-heritage-evolution.md#three-approaches-choose-your-path) for guidance.

## Key Concepts

**Trigger Mapping:**
- Strategic bridge from business goals to user psychology
- Based on 20+ years of Effect Management methodology
- Visual one-page map showing strategic connections
- Created through 5 structured workshops with Saga
- Includes both positive and negative psychological drivers

**The Three Strategic Layers:**
1. **Business Goals** - Your WHY (vision + SMART objectives)
2. **Target Groups** - The WHO (user types whose success drives yours)
3. **Usage Goals** - Their WHY (positive drivers + negative drivers)

**The Five Workshops:**
1. **Business Goals** - Define vision and measurable objectives
2. **Target Groups** - Identify and create personas
3. **Driving Forces** - Map positive and negative psychology
4. **Prioritization** - Rank groups and drivers by impact
5. **Feature Impact** - Score features against drivers

**WDS Modernization:**
- **Simplified:** Removed features from map (stays relevant longer)
- **Enhanced:** Added negative driving forces (fuller psychology)
- **Systematic:** Integrated feature scoring (data-driven decisions)

**Positive vs Negative Drivers:**
- **Positive:** What users want to achieve (goals, benefits, gains)
- **Negative:** What users want to avoid (fears, frustrations, pain)
- **Key insight:** People work harder to avoid pain than pursue gain
