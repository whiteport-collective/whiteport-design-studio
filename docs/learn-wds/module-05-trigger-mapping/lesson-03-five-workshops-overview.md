# Lesson 3: The Five Workshops Overview

**Your Roadmap to Strategic Clarity**

---

## What This Lesson Does

Before you dive into each workshop, let's step back and see the complete picture. This lesson gives you a comfortable understanding of the entire Trigger Mapping process - what happens, why it happens, and how it all fits together.

**You'll learn:**
- The flow of all 5 workshops
- How each workshop builds on the previous one
- What you'll create at each stage
- Why the process works
- What to expect when working with Saga

**Time:** 10-12 minutes  
**Goal:** Feel confident and prepared for the workshops ahead

---

## The Big Picture

Trigger Mapping happens through **5 structured workshops** facilitated by Saga the Analyst. Think of it as a guided conversation where Saga asks strategic questions and you provide the thinking.

**Total time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Format:** Conversational - like talking to a strategic consultant  
**Output:** Complete Trigger Map + scored feature list  
**Your role:** Provide strategic insight and make decisions  
**Saga's role:** Ask the right questions, ensure nothing is missed, document everything

---

## Why Five Workshops?

Each workshop answers one critical strategic question:

1. **Workshop 1: Business Goals** → "What does winning look like?"
2. **Workshop 2: Target Groups** → "WHO will make this happen through their product use?"
3. **Workshop 3: Driving Forces** → "What psychology drives their behavior?"
4. **Workshop 4: Prioritization** → "What matters most?"
5. **Workshop 5: Feature Impact** → "Which features have highest strategic impact?"

**Together, they create a complete chain** from business goals to feature decisions.

---

## The Flow: How Workshops Connect

Each workshop builds on what came before:

```
Workshop 1: Business Goals
    ↓
    "To achieve these goals, WHO do we need?"
    ↓
Workshop 2: Target Groups
    ↓
    "What drives THESE people's behavior?"
    ↓
Workshop 3: Driving Forces
    ↓
    "Which groups and drivers matter MOST?"
    ↓
Workshop 4: Prioritization
    ↓
    "Which features address our TOP priorities?"
    ↓
Workshop 5: Feature Impact
    ↓
Strategic Roadmap
```

**The result:** Every feature traces back through drivers → groups → goals. No guesswork, no orphaned features.

---

## What You'll Create in Each Workshop

### Workshop 1: Business Goals (15-20 min)

**You'll define:**
- Vision statement (visionary statement - aspirational)
- 3-5 strategic objectives (measurable, using SMART method)
- Connection between aspiration and measurement

**Example output:**
- Vision: "Make remote work sustainable and healthy"
- Strategic Objectives: "5,000 active teams by Q4", "70% retention rate"

**Why it matters:** Everything traces back to these goals.

---

### Workshop 2: Target Groups (20-25 min)

**You'll identify:**
- 3-5 user groups whose product usage drives your success
- Rich personas with context, goals, frustrations, fears
- Priority ranking by strategic value

**Example output:**
- Group 1: Remote Team Leads (managing 5-10 people, fear team burnout)
- Group 2: Solo Remote Workers (isolation, need structure)
- Group 3: Remote Executives (organizational visibility)

**Why it matters:** Different groups have different psychological drivers. You can't design for everyone.

---

### Workshop 3: Driving Forces (20-30 min)

**You'll map:**
- Positive drivers (what users want to achieve)
- Negative drivers (what users want to avoid)
- For each prioritized persona

**Example output:**
- Positive: "Want to demonstrate effective leadership"
- Negative: "Fear team burnout without noticing" (often more powerful)

**Why it matters:** This is the psychology that drives behavior. Design must address both sides.

---

### Workshop 4: Prioritization (15-20 min)

**You'll rank:**
- Target groups by strategic value
- Psychological drivers by emotional intensity
- Top 5-7 drivers become your scoring criteria

**Example output:**
1. Remote Team Leads (highest impact)
2. Fear of team burnout (most urgent driver)
3. Want to demonstrate leadership (career driver)

**Why it matters:** Creates focus. Not everything can be priority #1.

---

### Workshop 5: Feature Impact (20-30 min)

**You'll score:**
- 10-20 feature ideas against top drivers
- Each feature rated 0-3 on each driver
- Total scores create prioritized roadmap

**Example output:**
- Daily team pulse check: 9 points (addresses top fears)
- Team chat: 3 points (lower strategic impact)

**Why it matters:** Data-driven roadmap. Every feature justified by strategy.

---

## What Makes This Process Comfortable

### It's Conversational

**Not this:** Fill out complex forms and templates  
**This:** Answer Saga's questions in natural language

**Example:**
- **Saga:** "What's the grand ambition behind this project?"
- **You:** "We want to make remote work sustainable and healthy for distributed teams."
- **Saga:** "Great. When that vision is being realized, what will we observe in the world?"

### It's Guided

**You're never stuck wondering:**
- "What should I think about next?"
- "Am I missing something important?"
- "Is this specific enough?"

**Saga ensures:**
- Nothing is missed
- Vague answers get challenged
- Strategic focus is maintained
- Everything is documented

### It's Iterative

**You can:**
- Refine answers as you go
- Come back and adjust
- Challenge your own assumptions
- Update as you learn

**Not set in stone:** The Trigger Map evolves with your understanding.

### It's Practical

**No theory for theory's sake:**
- Every question has a purpose
- Every answer informs design
- Every output is actionable
- Complete in 60-90 minutes

---

## What to Expect: Your Experience

### Before You Start

**Preparation:**
- Have your Product Brief handy (reference for context)
- Set aside 60-90 minutes (can pause between workshops)
- Be ready to think strategically
- Don't worry about perfection - you can refine later

### During the Workshops

**The rhythm:**
1. Saga asks a question
2. You think and respond
3. Saga probes deeper or moves forward
4. Saga documents your answers
5. Repeat until workshop complete

**Your mindset:**
- Be specific (avoid generic statements)
- Think about real people and real psychology
- Challenge your assumptions
- Stay honest about unknowns
- Connect everything back to business goals

### After You Finish

**You'll have:**
- Complete Trigger Map (one-page strategic document)
- Scored feature list (data-driven roadmap)
- Clear reasoning for every decision
- Alignment tool for your team
- Foundation for all design work

---

## Common Questions

### "What if I don't know the answer to something?"

**That's valuable information.** Saga will help you identify:
- What you need to research
- What assumptions you're making
- Where you need user input

**It's okay to say:** "I'm not sure - we'd need to validate that with users."

### "Can I change my answers later?"

**Absolutely.** The Trigger Map is a living document. As you:
- Learn from users
- Test assumptions
- Gather data
- Refine strategy

You can update the map. The structure stays, the content evolves.

### "What if I have more than 5 target groups?"

**Start with 3-5 most strategic.** You can:
- Focus on highest-impact groups first
- Add more later if needed
- Combine similar groups

**Remember:** Trying to serve everyone equally means serving no one well.

### "How technical do I need to be?"

**Not at all.** This is about:
- Strategic thinking
- User psychology
- Business goals
- Prioritization

**Not about:** Code, architecture, technical implementation.

## What's Different from Traditional Approaches

### Traditional: Feature Brainstorming

**Problem:**
- "What features should we build?"
- No connection to strategy
- Loudest voice wins
- Orphaned features

### Trigger Mapping: Strategic Foundation

**Approach:**
- "What psychology drives our target users?"
- Every feature traces to strategy
- Data-driven decisions
- Complete traceability

---

### Traditional: Demographic Personas

**Problem:**
- "Males 25-40 with college degrees"
- Doesn't explain behavior
- Can't design from this

### Trigger Mapping: Behavioral Profiles

**Approach:**
- "Busy working parents juggling multiple kids' schedules, fearing family conflict"
- Explains psychology
- Actionable for design

---

### Traditional: All Features Equal

**Problem:**
- "Everything is important"
- No prioritization
- Diluted focus

### Trigger Mapping: Scored Impact

**Approach:**
- Feature A: 9 points (addresses top fears)
- Feature B: 3 points (nice-to-have)
- Clear priorities

---

## The Value You Get

### Strategic Clarity

**Before:** "We should probably build X because competitors have it"  
**After:** "Feature X scores 9 because it addresses our #1 persona's top fear, which drives our retention goal"

### Team Alignment

**Before:** Debates about what to build  
**After:** Shared understanding of strategy, priorities, and reasoning

### Defensible Decisions

**Before:** "I think this is important"  
**After:** "Here's the Trigger Map showing why this matters"

### Design Confidence

**Before:** Guessing what users need  
**After:** Knowing what psychology drives behavior
