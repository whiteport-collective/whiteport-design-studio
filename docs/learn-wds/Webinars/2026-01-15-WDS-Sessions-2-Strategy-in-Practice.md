## 📋 Session Overview

Build less. Decide more. Nail your digital strategies in your next project!

AI makes it ridiculously easy to build things. Which is both a gift… and a trap. Because every minute spent vibecoding "something cool" that you later throw away, steals focus from the one thing that actually moves the needle: **Building something that matters.**

Digital strategy is the step most teams try to skip. Not because it's unimportant, but because it's invisible work. No shiny UI. No dopamine from "it runs!" Just clarity. Direction. Decisions. And that's exactly why it matters.

### 🔍 What is Digital Strategy?

Digital strategy is the plan that answers:
- Who are we helping?
- What do they want to achieve?
- What must be true for this to work?
- What should we build first, second, or not at all?

It's how you avoid shipping a beautiful solution to the wrong problem. With AI tools, the cost of building is dropping fast. So the real competitive advantage becomes **choosing the right thing to build**.

### 🗺️ Strategy in Practice: Trigger Mapping (the WDS way)

In this session, we'll work hands-on with **Trigger Mapping**: a practical method for turning messy reality into a clear digital plan. Instead of starting with features, we start with the real world:

- What triggers a user to act?
- What do your users want to have happened?
- What do you think they wish to avoid?
- How can our software make their lives better?

Then we translate that into a strategy you can actually execute.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **What digital strategy is (and isn't)**: No fluff, no "vision statements", just usable clarity
- **How Trigger Mapping works**: Map the moments that create action, friction, and opportunity
- **How to avoid "AI-powered wandering"**: Stop generating prototypes that don't connect to outcomes
- **How designers can lead strategy**: Using your existing skills, amplified through WDS
- **How WDS helps**: Use the agents to document decisions, structure intent, and keep the project aligned

## 📝 Bring Your Curiosity

You don't need to arrive with a complete case, a perfect idea, or a polished plan. Just bring something you're building, considering, or stuck on, and we'll use it as material.

If you've ever thought: "Why are we building this?"…then you're in the right room.
