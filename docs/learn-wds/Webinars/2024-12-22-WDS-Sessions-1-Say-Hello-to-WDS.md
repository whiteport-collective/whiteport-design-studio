## 📋 Session Overview

Join Mårten Angner for an inspiring 60-minute session exploring the Whiteport Design Studio (WDS), a hands-on expansion for designers ready to move their craft into the development space and bring ideas to life directly in the IDE.

Built on the shoulders of giants—the proven BMAD Method—this approach empowers designers to take control of their workflow and collaborate seamlessly with both developers and AI.

### 🔍 Key Themes

**From Feeling Behind to Leading the Edge**
Like many designers, Mårten once felt lost in the AI revolution—unsure where designers fit in and quietly wondering if the profession was being replaced. After discovering the BMAD Method, he developed WDS as an expansion pack based on 25+ years of design experience, now supercharged by AI.

**Beyond Vibe Coding**
Great products are not created in 24 hours with a couple of prompts. Designers have years of experience understanding businesses and their needs, meeting users in research and usability studies. WDS ensures designers remain at the strategic center of product development, not pushed aside in the hunt for immediate satisfaction.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Leverage WDS**: Use the AI Agent framework to structure your design process for strategy, project documents, alignment documents, and project contracts
- **Collaborate with AI**: Partner with AI as a creative co-thinker to refine ideas and translate them into clear, actionable specifications
- **Sketch to Code**: Turn your sketches, wireframes, and designs into functional design specifications that become the product
- **Design Systems that Scale**: Build reusable, intelligent design components that integrate directly into developer workflows
- **Elevate Your Role**: Step into a new era of design—where creativity meets technology, and your ideas become instantly actionable

   - Code is just output—generated and regenerated from your design work

3. **IDE-First Workflow**
   - Working in the same environment as developers improves collaboration
   - Visual thinking meets technical implementation seamlessly

4. **Strategic Foundation Matters**
   - Trigger mapping connects business goals to user needs
   - Personas and scenarios ground your design decisions

5. **Designers Lead, AI Amplifies**
   - WDS positions designers at the strategic center
   - AI becomes your co-pilot, not your replacement
