## Step 1: Define Project Vision (10 min)

### What is it?

The project vision is a clear, compelling statement of what you're building and why it matters.

### How to do it:

**Ask yourself:**

- What problem does this solve?
- Who benefits from this solution?
- What makes this unique or valuable?
- What's the desired end state?

**Example (Dog Week):**

```
Vision: A family coordination platform that helps parents manage
their dog's care schedule, ensuring every family member knows their
responsibilities and the dog's needs are consistently met.
```

**Your turn:**

```
Write your project vision:
[Your vision here]
```

**AI Support:**

```
Agent: "Let me help you refine your vision. Tell me:
- What problem are you solving?
- Who is this for?
- What makes it valuable?"
```

## Step 2: Set Business Goals (10 min)

### What are they?

Specific, measurable objectives that define project success from a business perspective.

### How to do it:

**Framework: SMART Goals**

- **S**pecific - Clear and unambiguous
- **M**easurable - Can track progress
- **A**chievable - Realistic given resources
- **R**elevant - Aligned with business strategy
- **T**ime-bound - Has a deadline

**Example (Dog Week):**

```
Business Goals:
1. Acquire 1,000 active families within 6 months of launch
2. Achieve 70% weekly active user rate
3. Reduce family coordination time by 50%
4. Generate $50K MRR within 12 months
```

**Your turn:**

```
List 3-5 business goals:
1. [Goal 1]
2. [Goal 2]
3. [Goal 3]
```

**AI Support:**

```
Agent: "Let's make these goals SMART. For each goal, I'll help you:
- Make it specific and measurable
- Set realistic targets
- Define timeframes"
```

## Step 3: Identify Stakeholders (5 min)

### Who are they?

People who have a stake in the project's success or will be affected by it.

### How to do it:

**Categories:**

- **Primary Users** - Direct users of the product
- **Secondary Users** - Indirect beneficiaries
- **Business Stakeholders** - Decision makers, investors
- **Technical Stakeholders** - Developers, IT, infrastructure
- **External Stakeholders** - Partners, regulators, community

**Example (Dog Week):**

```
Stakeholders:
- Primary: Parents managing family dog care
- Secondary: Children participating in care, the dog
- Business: Founders, investors
- Technical: Development team, hosting provider
- External: Veterinarians (future integration)
```

**Your turn:**

```
List your stakeholders by category:
[Your stakeholders]
```

---

## Step 4: Document Constraints (10 min)

### What are they?

Limitations and requirements that shape your design decisions.

### How to do it:

**Categories:**

**Technical Constraints:**

- Platform requirements (web, mobile, desktop)
- Browser/device support
- Performance requirements
- Integration requirements
- Security/compliance needs

**Business Constraints:**

- Budget limitations
- Timeline requirements
- Resource availability
- Market positioning
- Competitive landscape

**Design Constraints:**

- Brand guidelines
- Accessibility requirements
- Localization needs
- Existing design systems

**Example (Dog Week):**

```
Constraints:
Technical:
- Must work on mobile (iOS/Android) and web
- Swedish language primary, English secondary
- GDPR compliance required
- Offline capability for core features

Business:
- 6-month timeline to MVP
- Bootstrap budget (no external funding yet)
- Small team (2 developers, 1 designer)

Design:
- Family-friendly visual language
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- Swedish cultural considerations
```

**Your turn:**

```
Document your constraints:
[Your constraints]
```

**AI Support:**

```
Agent: "Let's identify constraints you might have missed:
- Have you considered accessibility?
- What about localization?
- Any regulatory requirements?
- Performance expectations?"
```

## Step 5: Define Success Criteria (5 min)

### What is it?

Specific metrics that indicate whether the project achieved its goals.

### How to do it:

**Framework:**

- **User Success** - How users benefit
- **Business Success** - Revenue, growth, efficiency
- **Technical Success** - Performance, reliability, scalability
- **Design Success** - Usability, satisfaction, engagement

**Example (Dog Week):**

```
Success Criteria:

User Success:
- 80% of users report reduced coordination stress
- Average task completion time < 2 minutes
- 90% task completion rate

Business Success:
- 1,000 active families by month 6
- 70% weekly active users
- $50K MRR by month 12

Technical Success:
- 99.9% uptime
- Page load < 2 seconds
- Zero critical security issues

Design Success:
- SUS score > 75
- NPS score > 40
- 80% feature discoverability
```

**Your turn:**

```
Define your success criteria:
[Your criteria]
```

- Can we track these success criteria?"
```

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have all the information yet?**  
A: Start with what you know. Mark sections as "TBD" and refine as you learn more. The brief is a living document.

**Q: How detailed should constraints be?**  
A: Detailed enough to guide decisions. If a constraint will affect design choices, document it specifically.

**Q: Can I change the brief later?**  
A: Absolutely! The brief evolves as you learn. Update it when new information emerges or priorities shift.

**Q: What if stakeholders disagree on goals?**  
A: Use the brief to facilitate alignment discussions. Document disagreements and work toward consensus before proceeding.
