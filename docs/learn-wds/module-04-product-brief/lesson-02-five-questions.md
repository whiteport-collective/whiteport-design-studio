# Module 04: Product Brief

## Lesson 2: The 5 Strategic Questions

**What every Product Brief must answer**

---

## The Framework That Guides Everything

Every successful Product Brief answers 5 critical questions. These aren't just sections to fill out - they're the questions that guide every design decision throughout your project.

**The 5 Strategic Questions:**

1. **What & Why** - What are we building and why does it matter?
2. **Who** - Who is this for?
3. **How We'll Know** - How will we know it's successful?
4. **Context** - What else exists and how are we different?
5. **Boundaries** - What are our constraints?

When you can answer these questions clearly, everything else flows. When you can't, every decision becomes a debate.

## Question 1: What & Why

**What are we building and why does it matter?**

This is your vision and positioning. It's the north star that guides every decision.

### Vision: The Big Picture

Your vision is a clear, compelling statement of what you're building and why it matters. It's aspirational but grounded. It inspires but also guides.

**A good vision statement:**
- Describes what you're building
- Explains the problem you're solving
- Identifies who benefits
- Conveys why this matters

**Example structure:**
"We're building [PRODUCT] for [TARGET USER] because [PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY]. This matters because [IMPACT]."

**What makes a vision powerful:**
- ✅ Clear enough to guide decisions
- ✅ Inspiring enough to motivate the team
- ✅ Specific enough to say no to things that don't fit
- ✅ Flexible enough to allow creative solutions

**What makes a vision weak:**
- ❌ Too vague ("make the world better")
- ❌ Too tactical ("add a calendar feature")
- ❌ Too broad ("solve all problems")
- ❌ Too limiting ("exactly 3 buttons")

### Positioning: Who & What Makes It Unique

Positioning answers three critical questions:
- **Target:** Who is this for?
- **Value:** What problem does it solve?
- **Differentiation:** How is it different from alternatives?

**Why positioning matters:**
- Guides design decisions (what feels right for this audience?)
- Informs feature prioritization (what solves their problem best?)
- Shapes communication (how do we talk to them?)
- Prevents scope creep (does this fit our positioning?)

## Question 2: Who

**Who is this for?**

You can't design for "everyone." You need to know exactly who you're serving and who has a stake in the project's success.

### Target Users

**Primary Users:**
- Who uses the product directly?
- What are their goals and needs?
- What's their context and constraints?

**Secondary Users:**
- Who benefits indirectly?
- How does the product affect them?
- What do they need from it?

**Why this matters:**
Different users have different needs. You can't optimize for everyone. Knowing your primary users lets you make confident trade-offs.

### Stakeholders

**Business Stakeholders:**
- Who decides if this project continues?
- Who controls the budget?
- What do they need to see to consider it successful?

**Technical Stakeholders:**
- Who builds and maintains this?
- What are their constraints and preferences?
- What technical decisions affect them?

**Why this matters:**
Stakeholders aren't users, but they affect the project. Understanding their needs prevents surprises and ensures support.

## Question 3: How We'll Know

**How will we know it's successful?**

Success criteria are measurable outcomes that indicate whether the project achieved its goals. Without them, "success" is just opinion.

### The Four Dimensions of Success

**User Success:**
- How do users benefit?
- What behaviors change?
- What satisfaction metrics improve?

**Examples:**
- "80% of users report reduced stress"
- "Average task completion time < 2 minutes"
- "90% task completion rate"

**Business Success:**
- What business outcomes improve?
- What revenue or growth metrics matter?
- What efficiency gains occur?

**Examples:**
- "1,000 active users by month 6"
- "70% weekly active user rate"
- "$50K MRR by month 12"

**Technical Success:**
- What performance standards must be met?
- What reliability metrics matter?
- What security requirements exist?

**Examples:**
- "99.9% uptime"
- "Page load < 2 seconds"
- "Zero critical security issues"

**Design Success:**
- What usability standards must be met?
- What satisfaction scores matter?
- What engagement metrics indicate good design?

**Examples:**
- "SUS score > 75"
- "NPS score > 40"
- "80% feature discoverability"

### Making Criteria SMART

Every success criterion should be:
- **Specific** - Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable** - Can track progress
- **Achievable** - Realistic given resources
- **Relevant** - Aligned with project goals
- **Time-bound** - Has a deadline

**Weak criteria:**
- ❌ "Make it better"
- ❌ "Increase engagement"
- ❌ "Users will love it"

**Strong criteria:**
- ✅ "Increase daily active users by 40% within 3 months"
- ✅ "Reduce support tickets by 50% within 6 months"
- ✅ "Achieve NPS score of 45+ by launch"

## Question 4: Context

**What else exists and how are we different?**

Understanding the competitive landscape informs design decisions and positioning strategy.

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**
- Who offers the same solution?
- What do they do well?
- What do they do poorly?
- How are we different?

**Indirect Alternatives:**
- What other ways do people solve this problem?
- Why might someone choose those instead?
- What can we learn from them?

**Why this matters:**
- Informs design decisions (what's expected vs what's differentiated)
- Guides feature prioritization (what's table stakes vs competitive advantage)
- Shapes positioning (how we talk about what makes us different)
- Prevents "me too" design (copying without understanding why)

### Your Unique Positioning

**What makes you different:**
- Approach (how you solve the problem)
- Audience (who you serve)
- Experience (how it feels to use)
- Business model (how you make money)
- Technology (what enables your solution)

**Why differentiation matters:**
If you're not different, you're competing on price. If you're different in ways that matter to your target users, you're competing on value.

## Question 5: Boundaries

**What are our constraints?**

Constraints aren't limitations - they're clarity. They guide decisions and prevent wasted effort on impossible solutions.

### Technical Constraints

**Platform Requirements:**
- Web, mobile, desktop?
- Which browsers/devices?
- Online/offline capability?

**Integration Requirements:**
- What systems must it connect to?
- What APIs are available?
- What data needs to sync?

**Performance Requirements:**
- How fast must it load?
- How many users must it support?
- What's the acceptable downtime?

**Security & Compliance:**
- What data protection is required?
- What regulations apply (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)?
- What security standards must be met?

### Business Constraints

**Budget:**
- What's the total budget?
- What can be spent on design vs development?
- What's the runway?

**Timeline:**
- When must it launch?
- What are the key milestones?
- What's the MVP vs future phases?

**Resources:**
- How many people?
- What skills are available?
- What can be outsourced?

**Market Positioning:**
- What price point?
- What market segment?
- What brand perception?

### Design Constraints

**Brand Guidelines:**
- What visual standards exist?
- What voice and tone?
- What's on-brand vs off-brand?

**Accessibility:**
- What compliance level (WCAG 2.1 AA, AAA)?
- What specific disabilities to design for?
- What testing is required?

**Localization:**
- What languages?
- What cultural considerations?
- What regional variations?

**Existing Systems:**
- What design systems exist?
- What components are available?
- What patterns are established?

### Why Constraints Matter

**Constraints guide decisions:**
- "Should we add this feature?" → Check constraints
- "Can we support this platform?" → Check constraints
- "Should we use this approach?" → Check constraints

**Constraints prevent waste:**
- No designing solutions that can't be built
- No building for platforms you don't support
- No planning for budgets you don't have

**Constraints enable creativity:**
- Limitations force innovative solutions
- Boundaries create focus
- Clarity enables confident decisions

## How the Questions Work Together

These 5 questions aren't isolated - they work together to create a complete strategic picture.

**Vision & Positioning** (What & Why) → Guides everything else
↓
**Target Users** (Who) → Informs what success looks like
↓
**Success Criteria** (How We'll Know) → Defines measurable outcomes
↓
**Competitive Landscape** (Context) → Shapes differentiation strategy
↓
**Constraints** (Boundaries) → Grounds everything in reality

**When making any design decision:**
1. Does it align with the vision?
2. Does it serve the target users?
3. Does it contribute to success criteria?
4. Does it differentiate us from competitors?
5. Is it possible within our constraints?

If the answer to all 5 is yes, it's probably a good decision. If any answer is no, reconsider.

## The Power of Clear Answers

When everyone on your team can answer these 5 questions the same way, you have alignment. When they can't, you have chaos.

**With clear answers:**
- Designers make confident decisions
- Developers understand the "why"
- Stakeholders trust the direction
- Product managers prioritize effectively
- The team moves fast

**Without clear answers:**
- Every decision requires a meeting
- Every meeting creates more confusion
- Every confusion creates delay
- Every delay creates frustration

**This is why the Product Brief matters. It answers the questions before they become problems.**
