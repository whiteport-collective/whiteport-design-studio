## What Other Designers Say

### Testimonials

> "I was skeptical at first - another design methodology? But WDS changed how I think about my role. I'm no longer just making things pretty. I'm the strategic thinker who makes products come alive."
>
> **— Sarah K., Product Designer**

> "The 5x speed increase is real. But what surprised me most was how much clearer my thinking became. Writing conceptual specifications forced me to understand the 'why' at a deeper level."
>
> **— Marcus L., UX Lead**

> "I thought AI would replace me. WDS showed me how to make AI amplify my thinking instead. Now I'm the most valuable designer on my team."
>
> **— Priya S., Senior Designer**

> "The paradigm shift hit me in Module 4: my design IS the product. The code is just the printout. That completely changed how I approach every project."
>
> **— James T., Design Director**

## Common Questions

### FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No. WDS is about design thinking and specifications. AI handles the implementation.

A: The course includes practice exercises. You can also use a hypothetical project or redesign an existing app.

**Q: Can I use this with my current design process?**
A: Yes! WDS complements existing processes. Many designers integrate it gradually.

**Q: Is this only for digital products?**
A: WDS is optimized for digital products, but the principles apply to any design work.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Each module includes clear examples and guidance. The AI assistant can help clarify concepts as you learn.

**Q: Can I teach this to my team?**
A: Yes! WDS is open-source and free. Share it with your entire team.
