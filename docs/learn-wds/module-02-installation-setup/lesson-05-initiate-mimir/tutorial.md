## Whenever You Need Help

**Remember this simple command:**

```
@wds-mimir [your question]
```

**Examples:**

- `@wds-mimir Which agent should I work with for UX design?`
- `@wds-mimir I feel overwhelmed, where should I start?`
- `@wds-mimir Can you walk me through the WDS training?`

**No question is too small. Mimir is always here to guide you.**

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Can't find MIMIR file  
**Solution:** Make sure you added `whiteport-design-studio` to workspace (Lesson 04, Step 5)

**Issue:** Drag doesn't work  
**Solution:** Use `@MIMIR-WDS-ORCHESTRATOR.md` instead

**Issue:** AI doesn't respond  
**Solution:** Make sure you're connected to internet, wait a moment, try again

**Issue:** Not sure what to say  
**Solution:** Just say "Hello! I'm new and ready to start" - Mimir will guide you from there
