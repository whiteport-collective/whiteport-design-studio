## Part 1: Create GitHub Account

### What is GitHub?

Professional cloud storage + time machine for your project files. Every change is saved, you can go back to any version, work with others.

### Step 1: Sign Up

1. Go to **<https://github.com>**
2. Click **"Sign up"**
3. Enter email, password, username

**Username Tips:**
- Professional: `john-designer`, `sarahux`, `mike-creates`
- You might share this with clients

4. Verify email
5. Log in

**✅ Checkpoint:** You can log in to GitHub

## Part 2: Choose Your Scenario

**Scenario A:** Starting new project → Continue to Part 3  
**Scenario B:** Joining existing → Skip to Part 5  
**Scenario C:** Just learning → Skip to [Lesson 02](../lesson-02-ide-installation/02-full-lesson.md)

## Part 3: Create Repository

1. Click profile icon → **"Your repositories"** → **"New"**

### Decide Repository Structure

**IMPORTANT: Your naming choice determines your structure!**

**Single Repository:**
- Name: `my-project` (e.g., `dog-walker-app`)
- Structure: Specs + code together
- Use when: Small team, building yourself, simple communication

**Separate Specifications Repository:**
- Name: `my-project-specs` (e.g., `dog-walker-app-specs`)
- Structure: Specs only, separate code repo
- Use when: Corporate, many developers, clear handoff needed

---

## Part 4: Create Repository

**Repository Settings:**
- Name: `____________` (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- Description: One-liner about project
- Public (portfolio) or Private (client work)
- ☑️ Check "Initialize with README"
- Click **"Create repository"**

**✅ Checkpoint:** Repository created

---

## Part 5: Join Existing Repository

**Email template:**

```
Hi [Name],

I'd like to contribute to [project-name] using WDS methodology. 
Could you add me as a collaborator?

My GitHub username: [your-username]

Thank you!
```

**Then:**
1. Accept invitation from email
2. Check repo name (ends in `-specs`? Separate repo)
3. Browse structure (has `docs/`? WDS already!)

**✅ Checkpoint:** Access granted

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Verification email missing → Check spam  
**Issue:** Username taken → Try `yourname-designer-2`  
**Issue:** Repository name taken → Add your username
