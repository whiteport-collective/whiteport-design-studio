# Value Trigger Chain (VTC)

**A lightweight strategic framework for connecting business goals to user psychology**

---

## What It Is

A **Value Trigger Chain (VTC)** is the minimum viable strategic context for creating purposeful design. It's a selected path through your strategic landscape that shows:

- **Business Goal** - What success looks like for the organization
- **Solution** - The specific thing being built to achieve that goal
- **User** - Who will use this solution
- **Driving Forces** - What motivates that user (wishes and fears)
- **Customer Awareness** - Where the user starts and where we want to move them

**Why VTC Matters:**

Without explicit strategic understanding of the business behind a digital product and the reasons why a user might wish to benefit from using it, design decisions become mere guess work ("I like this") rather than purposeful ("This serves our business goal by triggering the user's wish to X"). While you *can* design without a VTC, you risk:
- Creating beautiful but ineffective solutions
- Making decisions based on personal preference rather than user psychology
- Missing opportunities to align design with business goals
- Difficulty explaining or defending design choices
- Lower conversion rates and user satisfaction

**What VTC Provides:**

A VTC is a heuristic - a quick strategic shortcut. True strategic grounding requires business analysis, user research, and ideally a full Trigger Map with prioritization. However, as a rapid way to establish rough direction, VTC is remarkably effective:
- Disqualifies catastrophic ideas early ("This doesn't serve any user driving force")
- Gets discussions moving in a productive direction
- Provides enough context for meaningful design decisions
- Far better than no strategic grounding at all
- Can evolve into a full Trigger Map when project scope warrants it

Think of it as strategic scaffolding: sufficient to build on, but not the complete architectural blueprint.

**Structure:**

```
Business Goal → Solution → User → Driving Forces → Customer Awareness Progression
```

**Example:**

| Business Goal | Solution | User | Driving Forces | Customer Awareness |
|--------------|----------|------|----------------|--------------------|
| 500 newsletter signups | Landing page with trend insights | Harriet (hairdresser, ambitious, small town) | • Wish to be local beauty authority<br>• Fear of missing industry trends | Problem Aware → Product Aware |

## Why It Matters

### The Problem Without VTC

Designers often create without strategic grounding:
- Content lacks purpose
- Messaging feels generic
- Design decisions are subjective ("I like this color")
- No clear success criteria
- Hard to prioritize features or content

### The Solution With VTC

Every design decision has strategic context:
- Content targets specific driving forces
- Messaging addresses user psychology
- Design serves measurable goals
- Clear prioritization based on VTC impact
- Objective evaluation of design effectiveness

**The core insight:** Value is TRIGGERED when a user's driving forces are TRIGGERED. The VTC makes this triggering intentional rather than accidental.

## How It's Valuable in Strategic Design

### 1. **Prioritization**
When you have multiple design options, ask: "Which best serves our VTC?" Clear answer emerges.

### 2. **Content Creation**
Every piece of content can reference its VTC to ensure strategic alignment and emotional resonance.

### 3. **Stakeholder Alignment**
VTCs create shared understanding. Everyone knows WHY we're building WHAT for WHOM.

### 4. **Measurement**
Each VTC element is measurable:
- Business Goal: Quantifiable metric
- User: Identifiable segment
- Driving Forces: Observable behaviors
- Customer Awareness: Progression tracking

### 5. **Scalability**
- 1 VTC: Quick prototype
- 3 VTCs: Focused product
- 10+ VTCs: Complex platform with multiple user types

Start small, scale strategically.

## Derived From

The VTC method derives from **Effect Management** (inUse, Sweden) and **Impact Mapping** (Gojko Adzic), which pioneered the concept of visually connecting business goals to user behaviors.

VTC is Whiteport's lightweight adaptation, adding:
- **Customer Awareness positioning** (from Eugene Schwartz)
- **Negative driving forces** (fears and frustrations)
- **Standalone usability** (can exist without full Trigger Map)

**Related Whiteport Methods:**
- [Trigger Mapping Guide](./phase-2-trigger-mapping-guide.md) - Comprehensive version containing multiple VTCs
- [Scenario Definition](./phase-4-ux-design-guide.md) - VTCs anchor each scenario

**Foundational Models:**
- [Customer Awareness Cycle](../models/customer-awareness-cycle.md) - Eugene Schwartz (positioning users)
- [Impact Mapping](../models/impact-effect-mapping.md) - Gojko Adzic (strategic connections)

## When to Use VTC

### Use Direct VTC When:
- **Timeline:** < 2 weeks
- **Scope:** 1-3 key flows, prototype, MVP
- **Users:** Single primary user type
- **Budget:** < $10k
- **Goal:** Quick strategic grounding without extensive mapping

### Use Full Trigger Map (Contains Many VTCs) When:
- **Timeline:** > 1 month
- **Scope:** Complex product, many scenarios
- **Users:** Multiple distinct user types
- **Budget:** > $25k
- **Goal:** Long-term strategic foundation

**The relationship:** Trigger Map = Multiple VTCs + Relationships + Prioritization

## How to Create a VTC

### Step 1: Define Business Goal (5 minutes)

What does success look like? Be specific and measurable.

**Good:** "500 newsletter signups in Q1"  
**Bad:** "More engagement"

### Step 2: Identify Solution (2 minutes)

What are you building to achieve this goal?

**Examples:**
- Landing page with lead magnet
- Onboarding flow
- Feature upgrade prompt
- Email campaign + dashboard

### Step 3: Describe User (5 minutes)

Who will use this solution? Go beyond demographics to psychology.

**Template:**
```
[Name] ([role], [key traits])
- Context: [when/where they encounter solution]
- Current state: [what they're trying to accomplish]
```

**Example:**
```
Harriet (hairdresser, ambitious, small-town)
- Context: Late evening, researching industry trends
- Current state: Wants to stay ahead of competitors
```

### Step 4: Identify Driving Forces (10 minutes)

What motivates this user? Include both wishes (positive) and fears (negative).

**Wishes (Positive Driving Forces):**
- What do they want to achieve?
- What would make them feel successful?
- What aspirations drive their actions?

**Fears (Negative Driving Forces):**
- What do they want to avoid?
- What keeps them up at night?
- What would feel like failure?

**Example:**
- ✅ Wish to be local beauty authority
- ❌ Fear of missing industry trends
- ✅ Wish to attract premium clients
- ❌ Fear of being seen as outdated

**Pro tip:** Positive and negative are often two sides of the same coin. Include both for fuller picture.

### Step 5: Position Customer Awareness (5 minutes)

Where is this user NOW in their awareness journey? Where do we want to move them?

**Customer Awareness Stages:**
1. **Unaware** - Doesn't know problem exists
2. **Problem Aware** - Knows problem, doesn't know solutions
3. **Solution Aware** - Knows solutions exist, doesn't know yours
4. **Product Aware** - Knows your solution exists
5. **Most Aware** - Has used, loved, and advocates for your solution

**VTC Format:** `[Start] → [End]`

**Examples:**
- "Problem Aware → Solution Aware" (introducing new approach)
- "Product Aware → Most Aware" (onboarding flow)
- "Unaware → Problem Aware" (educational content)

### Step 6: Document & Validate (3 minutes)

Write your VTC in table format:

| Business Goal | Solution | User | Driving Forces | Customer Awareness |
|--------------|----------|------|----------------|--------------------|
| [goal] | [solution] | [user description] | • [positive force]<br>• [negative force]<br>• [another force] | [start] → [end] |

**Validation Questions:**
1. Is the business goal measurable?
2. Does the solution serve both the goal AND the user?
3. Are driving forces specific enough to inform design?
4. Does the customer awareness progression make sense for this solution?
5. Can we design/write content differently based on this VTC?

If you answered "no" to any question, refine that element.

## Using VTCs in Your Design Process

### In Project Pitch
- Define 1 simplified VTC to communicate strategic vision
- Helps stakeholders understand WHO, WHY, and HOW

### In Scenario Definition
- Assign primary VTC to each scenario
- All pages in scenario inherit this VTC by default
- Optional: Define secondary VTCs for specific page sections

### In Content Creation
- Before writing any content, identify applicable VTC
- Generate content that triggers the driving forces
- Move user along customer awareness spectrum
- Explain reasoning: "This content serves VTC-01 by..."

### In Component Specifications
- Microcopy references VTC
- Error messages address fears (negative driving forces)
- Success states celebrate wishes (positive driving forces)

### In Design Deliveries
- Show which VTC each flow serves
- Helps developers understand strategic intent
- Informs prioritization decisions

### In Testing
- Validate: Did we trigger the driving forces?
- Measure: Did user progress in customer awareness?
- Test: Does design serve the business goal?

## Imaginary Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Onboarding

**VTC:**

| Business Goal | Solution | User | Driving Forces | Customer Awareness |
|--------------|----------|------|----------------|--------------------|
| 60% activation rate | Interactive onboarding flow | Sarah (marketing manager, stretched thin) | • Wish to prove ROI to boss<br>• Fear of wasting time on complex tools | Product Aware → Most Aware |

**Design Implications:**
- Show ROI immediately (addresses "prove ROI" wish)
- Make first value moment < 2 minutes (addresses "fear of wasting time")
- Progress indicators show "almost done" (reduces anxiety)
- Success state: "You're ready to show your team"

### Example 2: E-commerce Product Page

**VTC:**

| Business Goal | Solution | User | Driving Forces | Customer Awareness |
|--------------|----------|------|----------------|--------------------|
| 15% conversion rate | Product page with social proof | James (first-time buyer, cautious) | • Wish to make smart purchase<br>• Fear of buying wrong product | Solution Aware → Product Aware |

**Design Implications:**
- Detailed specs (addresses "smart purchase" wish)
- Return policy prominent (reduces "wrong product" fear)
- Customer reviews front and center (social proof reduces risk)
- Comparison table (helps make informed decision)

### Example 3: Newsletter Signup (Context-Specific Goals)

**VTC:**

| Business Goal | Solution | User | Driving Forces | Customer Awareness |
|--------------|----------|------|----------------|--------------------|
| 500 signups | Landing page with trend insights | Harriet (hairdresser, ambitious, small-town) | • Wish to be local beauty authority<br>• Fear of missing industry trends | Problem Aware → Product Aware |

**Understanding Context:**

Harriet has many life goals (parent, business owner, friend), but in the context of **discovering a beauty trends newsletter**, only her professional goals are active:

*Active in this context:*
- Professional status and influence
- Staying current with industry
- Competitive advantage locally

*Not active in this context:*
- Her parenting goals
- Her financial planning
- Her social life

**Design Implications:**
- Headline: "Never Miss a Trend" (addresses fear directly in THIS context)
- Subhead: "Become Your Town's Beauty Authority" (speaks to wish in THIS situation)
- Lead magnet: "This Week's Top 5 Trends" (immediate professional value)
- Testimonial: "My clients always ask how I stay so current!"

**Why Context Matters:**

The same landing page wouldn't mention:
- "Balance work and family" (different context)
- "Manage salon finances" (different usage situation)
- "Plan your social calendar" (different need)

VTCs focus on the **active goals in the specific usage situation**.

**See:** [WDS Presentation Example](../examples/WDS-Presentation/)

**VTCs Defined:**
- Stina the Strategist (designer wanting better tools)
- Lars the Leader (executive wanting team efficiency)
- Felix the Full-Stack (developer wanting clearer specs)

Each section of the page targets specific driving forces from these VTCs, demonstrating how strategic grounding shapes content and design.

**Explore:**
- [Product Brief](../examples/WDS-Presentation/docs/1-project-brief/01-product-brief.md) - Shows business goals and positioning
- [Trigger Map](../examples/WDS-Presentation/docs/2-trigger-map/00-trigger-map.md) - Contains all VTCs for the project
- [Personas](../examples/WDS-Presentation/docs/2-trigger-map/) - Detailed user profiles with driving forces

## VTC in Different Contexts

### Lightweight VTC (Direct Definition)

**When:** Quick projects, prototypes, single-feature work

**Process:**
1. 30-minute VTC workshop
2. Define 1-3 VTCs directly
3. Use VTCs to guide design
4. No full Trigger Map needed

**Output:** Simple table or YAML file with VTCs

### VTC from Trigger Map (Extracted)

**When:** Complex projects with multiple user types

**Process:**
1. Create full Trigger Map (1-2 days)
2. Extract VTCs from map for each scenario
3. VTCs reference back to richer context
4. Update map as project evolves

**Output:** VTCs with deep context and relationships

### The Spectrum

```
Quick (1 day)          Medium (1 week)         Large (months)
│                      │                       │
1 VTC directly    →    2-3 VTCs directly   →  Full Trigger Map
Single scenario        Focused scope           containing 10+ VTCs
Minimal docs           Some prioritization     Complete strategic map
```

**Start where your project needs to start. Scale up if needed.**

## Common Questions

### Q: How many VTCs do I need?

**A:** Start with one per major user type or key scenario. For a simple product: 1-3 VTCs. For a complex platform: 10-20 VTCs.

### Q: Can a page serve multiple VTCs?

**A:** Yes! Often a page serves a primary VTC but specific sections address secondary VTCs. Document this in your page specification.

### Q: What if I have multiple business goals?

**A:** Create separate VTCs for each. One VTC might serve multiple goals, but each VTC should have a clear primary goal.

### Q: How detailed should driving forces be?

**A:** Specific enough to inform design decisions. "Want to save time" is too vague. "Fear of spending hours learning yet another tool" informs design.

### Q: When do I need a full Trigger Map instead of just VTCs?

**A:** When you have:
- Multiple user types with complex relationships
- Need to prioritize across many scenarios
- Long-term product requiring strategic foundation
- Stakeholders needing comprehensive strategic view
