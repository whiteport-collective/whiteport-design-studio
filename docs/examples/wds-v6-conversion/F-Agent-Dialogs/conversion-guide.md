# WDS Conversion Logs

**Session-by-session documentation of WDS v6 conversion work**

---

## Purpose

This directory contains detailed logs of each conversion session, keeping the main roadmap focused on current and future work.

---

## Structure

Each session gets its own log file:

- `session-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` - Detailed work log for that session

---
