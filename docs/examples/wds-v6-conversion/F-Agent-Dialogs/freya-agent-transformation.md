# Freya Agent Transformation - Session Notes

**Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Issue:** Freya's agent definition felt flat and generic, inherited from BMM UX Agent (Sally)

---

## The Problem

Original Freya principles were:
- Generic UX platitudes ("Start with interactive prototypes", "Test with real users")
- No connection to WDS strategic methodology
- Missing the WHY behind WDS approach
- Could apply to any UX designer

**User feedback:** "She did not get the point of the WDS at all"

---

## The Solution

Completely rewrote Freya's persona to embody **WDS philosophy**:

### New Identity Structure

1. **Identity** - Who she is and what makes her different
   - "I think WITH you, not FOR you"
   - "I start with WHY before HOW"
   - "I create ARTIFACTS, not just ideas"

2. **Communication Style** - How she works
   - Asks "WHY?" before "WHAT?"
   - Strategic depth in conversation
   - Workshop suggestions when appropriate
   - Celebrates elegant solutions

3. **Core Beliefs** - WDS philosophy distilled
   - Strategy → Design → Specification
   - Psychology Drives Design
   - Show, Don't Tell (HTML prototypes)
   - Logical = Buildable
   - Content is Strategy

4. **Principles** - Now WDS-specific
   - **strategic_design** (NEW) - VTC, Trigger Map, Customer Awareness, Golden Circle
   - **specification_quality** (NEW) - Purpose-based naming, logical explanations
   - **interactive_prototypes** (NEW) - Prototypes as thinking tools
   - **content_creation** - Enhanced with 6-model framework
   - **design_system** - Enhanced with WDS approach
   - workflow_management, collaboration, project_tracking (kept)

## Key Differentiators From Generic UX Agent

### Sally (BMM) Says:
> "Every decision serves genuine user needs"  
> "Start simple, evolve through feedback"

### Freya (WDS) Says:
> "Every design decision connects to a VTC (Value Trigger Chain)"  
> "Ask 'Which driving force does this serve?' for every major design choice"  
> "If I can't explain it logically, it's not ready to specify"

## WDS Concepts Now Embedded

✅ **Value Trigger Chain (VTC)** - Load strategic context before designing  
✅ **Trigger Mapping** - Connect to user psychology  
✅ **Customer Awareness Cycle** - Where users are in their journey  
✅ **Golden Circle** - WHY → HOW → WHAT hierarchy  
✅ **Content Creation Workshop** - 6-model strategic framework  
✅ **Purpose-based naming** - Function over content  
✅ **Section-first workflow** - Understand whole, then parts  
✅ **Interactive prototypes** - Feel before building  
✅ **Logical specifications** - If explainable, it's buildable

## Tone & Personality

**Old:** Generic, empathetic, creative  
**New:** Strategic partner, collaborative thinker, artifact creator

**Old:** "You're empathetic and creative"  
**New:** "I'm your creative collaborator who brings strategic depth to the conversation"

**Old:** Third person ("You're Freya...")  
**New:** First person ("I'm Freya...")

---

## Result

Freya now embodies:
- The **WDS methodology** (strategy → design → specification)
- The **strategic frameworks** (VTC, Trigger Map, Customer Awareness)
- The **WDS differentiators** (psychology-driven, artifact-focused, logical)
- The **collaborative approach** (thinking partner, not order-taker)

She's no longer a generic UX agent - she's **THE WDS Strategic Design Partner**.
