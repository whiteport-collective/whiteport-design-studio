## Emotional Transformation Goals

## Design Focus Statement

**The WDS Presentation Page transforms designers from overwhelmed task-doers into empowered strategic leaders who shoulder complexity as a calling, not a burden.**

**Primary Design Target:** Stina the Strategist (Designer)

**Must Address (Critical for Conversion):**
1. Fear of AI replacing designers → Show how WDS makes designers indispensable
2. Lack of confidence with AI tools → Provide structured, hand-holding path
3. Feeling overwhelmed and sidelined → Position as strategic leader who shoulders complexity
4. Wasting time on tools that don't work → Prove methodology with real results (Dog Week case study)
5. Not being valued → Show path to becoming "go-to expert" asked for advice

**Should Address (Supporting Conversion):**
1. Lars needs trust signals → Show entrepreneurs how WDS designers deliver business value
2. Felix needs to see benefits → Quick mention that specs will be better
3. Community proof → Show the 50 evangelists emerging (testimonials, case studies)
4. Learning curve concerns → Module structure with hand-holding clear
5. Integration with dev workflow → BMad Method foundation explained
