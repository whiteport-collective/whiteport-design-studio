## Interface with WDS (Optional)

### If Felix Gets Curious

Some developers might get interested in WDS agents for simple UI tasks. For Felix:

**Potential Interest:**
- WDS agents for quick UI mockups
- When forced to do interface work, agents could help
- Structured approach might appeal to his love of systems

**Likely Approach:**
- Cautious, like his approach to AI code
- Interested but skeptical
- Would try for simple UI tasks when desperate
- Still prefers working with skilled designer

**Not Primary Focus:**
- Felix is tertiary target
- Main benefit is receiving better specs
- Any direct WDS use is bonus, not goal
