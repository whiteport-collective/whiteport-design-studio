# Step 6: Position Customer Awareness

**Duration:** 5-10 minutes

**Purpose:** Define awareness start/end (typically NOT in Trigger Map - defined per scenario)

---

## Process

**Use same exploratory approach as Creation Workshop:**

Explore what user knows NOW and what transformation happens.

See: [Creation Workshop Step 6](../creation-steps/step-06-customer-awareness.md) for full exploration questions.

---

## Quick Exploration Questions

### Current State:

1. **"Do they know something's wrong?"**
2. **"What language are they using?"** (when talking about this)
3. **"What are they looking for?"** (search terms, questions)
4. **"Have they tried anything?"** (your product, competitors, nothing)

### Desired Transformation:

1. **"What will they realize?"** (new insight)
2. **"What will they be able to articulate?"** (to a friend)
3. **"What action becomes possible?"** (what can they DO now)

## Capture with Context

```yaml
customer_awareness:
  start: "[Stage]"
  start_context: "[What they know/feel NOW]"
  end: "[Stage]"
  end_context: "[What they'll know/feel AFTER]"
  transformation: "[Key shift that happens]"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
customer_awareness:
  start: "Solution Aware"
  start_context: "Researching design tools, overwhelmed by options"
  end: "Product Aware"
  end_context: "Knows WDS exists, understands it's agent-based, considering trial"
  transformation: "From 'tools are complex' to 'this specific approach might work'"
```

---

## Validate Through Story

**Ask user:**
> "Walk me through their awareness journey in this scenario."

Story should flow naturally and match the selected driving forces from Trigger Map.
