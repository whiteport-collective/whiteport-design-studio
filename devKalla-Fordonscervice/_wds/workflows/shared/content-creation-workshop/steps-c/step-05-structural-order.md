# Step 5: Determine Structural Order

**Apply the Golden Circle to create persuasive content flow**

---

## Purpose

Simon Sinek's Golden Circle provides the structural order that makes content persuasive: **WHY → HOW → WHAT**. Most content does it backward (WHAT → HOW → WHY) and fails to inspire action. This step sequences your content for maximum impact.

---

## Duration

⏱️ **3-5 minutes**

---

## The Single Task

**Map all content from previous steps into WHY → HOW → WHAT sequence**

---

## Context from Previous Steps

**VTC:** Business goal, user, driving forces  
**Awareness Strategy:** Language, information priorities, emotional journey  
**Action Filter:** Essential information that enables action  
**Empowerment Frame:** Transformation, capability framing, "aha moment"

---

## The Golden Circle

**Quick Reference:** See [substeps/05-golden-circle-guide.md](substeps/05-golden-circle-guide.md) for detailed framework explanation.

```
WHY (Emotion) → HOW (Method) → WHAT (Specifics)
```

**WHY** - Emotional truth, purpose (connects to driving forces)  
**HOW** - Method, approach (bridges emotion to action)  
**WHAT** - Specifics, proof (enables action)

---

## Questions for the User

### 1. Identify the WHY

**"What's the emotional opening that connects to their driving forces?"**

- Opens with user's current emotional state (from Empowerment Frame)
- Connects to driving forces (from VTC)
- Makes them care before explaining solution

**"What's the opening that makes them say 'that's me'?"**

---

### 2. Identify the HOW

**"What's the method that bridges emotional need to specific solution?"**

- Explains the approach or process
- Shows how transformation happens
- Uses capability framing (from Step 4)
- Contains the "aha moment" insight

**"Which essential information belongs in the HOW section?"**

---

### 3. Identify the WHAT

**"What are the concrete specifics and call to action?"**

- Names the product/offer
- Provides social proof
- Clear CTA with capability framing
- Risk removal

**"Which information belongs in WHAT—the final specifics?"**

---

### 4. Map Content to Structure

**"Let's organize all essential information into WHY-HOW-WHAT:"**

Present all content from Steps 3-4 (Action Filter + Empowerment Frame).

**Work together to assign each piece:**
- This goes in WHY (emotional opening)
- This goes in HOW (method/bridge)
- This goes in WHAT (specifics/proof)

---

### 5. Sequence Within Sections

**"Within each section, what's the most persuasive order?"**

**WHY section:** Problem → Validation → Aspiration  
**HOW section:** Approach → Differentiator → Transformation  
**WHAT section:** Naming → Proof → Action → Risk Removal

**"Does the sequence within each section flow smoothly?"**

---

### 6. Validate Persuasive Flow

**"Does WHY → HOW → WHAT create natural emotional → logical → action flow?"**

- Can user understand WHY without knowing WHAT yet?
- Does HOW bridge the gap naturally?
- Does WHAT feel like natural conclusion (not premature)?

**"Does anything feel out of order or jarring?"**

---

## Agent Actions

1. **Help user identify** the WHY (emotional truth/purpose)
2. **Help user identify** the HOW (method/bridge)
3. **Help user identify** the WHAT (specifics/proof)
4. **Map all essential information** from previous steps into WHY-HOW-WHAT
5. **Sequence content within sections** for smooth flow
6. **Validate persuasive flow** end-to-end
7. **Document the structure**

---

## Validation

Before proceeding to Step 6:

- [ ] WHY is identified (emotional opening, purpose)
- [ ] HOW is identified (method, bridge, differentiator)
- [ ] WHAT is identified (specifics, proof, CTA)
- [ ] All essential information assigned to WHY, HOW, or WHAT
- [ ] Content sequenced within each section
- [ ] Flow feels natural and persuasive (WHY → HOW → WHAT)
- [ ] Nothing feels out of order or premature

---

## Output

**Structural Order Document:**

```yaml
structural_order:
  section_why:
    purpose: "Emotional truth / Why user should care"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "[Opening hook]"
        rationale: "[Why this opens]"
      - order: 2
        element: "[Validation or aspiration]"
        rationale: "[Why this comes second]"
  
  section_how:
    purpose: "Method / Bridge from emotion to specifics"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "[Solution approach]"
        rationale: "[Why this bridges first]"
      - order: 2
        element: "[Key differentiator]"
        rationale: "[Why this matters here]"
      - order: 3
        element: "[Transformation path]"
        rationale: "[Why this comes last in HOW]"
  
  section_what:
    purpose: "Specifics / Proof / Action"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "[Product/offer name]"
        rationale: "[Why we can name it now]"
      - order: 2
        element: "[Social proof]"
        rationale: "[Why proof comes here]"
      - order: 3
        element: "[CTA]"
        rationale: "[Why action comes last]"
  
  flow_validation:
    feels_natural: "[yes/no + notes]"
    persuasive_arc: "[Does WHY → HOW → WHAT create emotional → logical → action flow?]"
```

## Next Step

Once structure is determined:

**→ Proceed to [Step 6: Generate & Review Content](step-06-generate-content.md)**

---

## Example

**See:** [substeps/05-example-golden-circle.md](substeps/05-example-golden-circle.md)

This shows complete WHY → HOW → WHAT sequencing for hairdresser newsletter content, with detailed rationale for each element's placement and order

---

## Notes

- The Golden Circle is fractal—you can apply WHY-HOW-WHAT at page level AND within each section
- If WHAT comes before WHY, content feels salesy and pushy
- If WHY is missing, content feels cold and transactional
- The "aha moment" from Step 4 often lives in the HOW section (the insight that bridges emotion to action)
- This structure works for pages, sections, paragraphs, even sentences

**⚠️ ALPHA:** Did this structural sequencing feel helpful? Or was it redundant with previous steps? Feedback appreciated.
