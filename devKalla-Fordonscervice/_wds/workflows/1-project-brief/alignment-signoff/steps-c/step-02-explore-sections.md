# Step 2: Explore Pitch Sections

## Purpose

Guide the user through exploring all pitch sections in a natural, collaborative flow.

## Pitch Structure (All Sections to Cover)

**Inspired by proven frameworks**: Customer-Problem-Solution, Value Proposition Canvas, Problem-Agitate-Solve, Business Case Framework

The pitch should eventually cover these 10 sections:

1. **The Realization** - What we've realized needs attention (PAS: Problem)
2. **Why It Matters** - Why this matters and who we help (Value Prop Canvas: Customer Profile + Impact)
3. **How We See It Working** - Brief overview of the solution approach (CPS: Solution)
4. **Paths We Explored** - 2-3 solution options we considered
5. **Recommended Solution** - Preferred approach and why (CPS: Solution)
6. **The Path Forward** - How the work will be done (WDS phases and practical approach)
7. **The Value We'll Create** - What happens if we DO build this (Business Case: Return)
8. **Cost of Inaction** - What happens if we DON'T build this (PAS: Agitate / Business Case: Risk)
9. **Our Commitment** - Resources needed and potential risks (Business Case: Cost + Risk)
10. **Summary** - Summary of key points

**Note**: You don't need to cover these in this exact order. Follow the user's natural thinking flow. The frameworks are guides, not rigid rules.

## Detect Starting Point

**Ask**: "Where would you like to start? Are you seeing a problem that needs solving, or do you have a solution in mind?"

**If user starts with problem**:
- Explore the problem first
- Then naturally move to "who is affected"
- Then explore solutions

**If user starts with solution**:
- Capture the solution idea
- Then explore "what problem does this solve?"
- Then explore "who is affected"
- Then explore other possible approaches

**If user starts elsewhere**:
- Follow their lead
- Guide them through remaining sections naturally

## Guiding Principles

**When responding to user ideas or questions, follow this pattern:**

1. **Acknowledge** - "I hear you asking about..." or "That's an interesting idea..."
2. **Summarize** - "So you're thinking that..." or "What I'm understanding is..."
3. **Confirm understanding** - "Is that right?" or "Am I understanding correctly?"
4. **Then explore solutions** - Only after confirming understanding, offer options or suggestions

**Never jump straight to bullet lists or solutions.** Always acknowledge, summarize, and confirm understanding first.

**Collaborative, not interrogative**:
- "Let's explore this together..."
- "What I'm hearing is..."
- "This is interesting - tell me more about..."
- "How do you see this working?"

**Allow ideas to evolve**:
- If user's idea changes as they talk, that's good!
- Reflect back: "It sounds like your thinking is evolving - that's great!"
- Update understanding as you go

**Natural flow**:
- Don't force a rigid sequence
- Follow the user's thinking
- Guide them to cover all sections, but in whatever order makes sense

**Make it shine**:
- Help them articulate their idea clearly
- Find the compelling angles
- Present it in the best light

## Section Exploration Guide

**Reference**: `src/modules/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/section-guide.md`

Use the section guide to explore each section as the user naturally moves through them.

**Important**: The Work Plan section (section 6) explains which WDS phases will be used and how the work will be done practically. This helps stakeholders understand the approach and workflow.

**Framework Inspiration**: This guide draws from proven frameworks:
- **Customer-Problem-Solution (CPS)** - Clear structure
- **Value Proposition Canvas** - Understanding customer needs
- **Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)** - Natural flow
- **Business Case Framework** - Investment and consequences

## Best Practice: Realization Section with Evidence

**When exploring "The Realization" section**, help the user identify and confirm the realization with evidence:

### Step 1: Identify the Realization
- What have you realized needs attention?
- What observation or challenge are you seeing?
- What opportunity is being missed?

### Step 2: Confirm It's Real
- Is there evidence that supports this realization?
- Do stakeholders recognize this as real?
- Does this matter to stakeholders?

### Step 3: Gather Evidence

**Help them identify both types of evidence:**

**Soft Evidence** (qualitative indicators):
- **Testimonials**: "Do you have customer feedback or testimonials about this?"
- **Complaints**: "What complaints or support tickets mention this?"
- **Observations**: "What patterns have you observed?"
- **Interviews**: "What do user interviews or conversations reveal?"
- **Indications**: "What signs indicate this is a problem?"

**Hard Evidence** (quantitative data):
- **Statistics**: "Do you have numbers or percentages?"
- **Analytics**: "What do analytics or usage data show?"
- **Surveys**: "Have you run surveys or tests?"
- **Logs**: "What do server logs or error reports indicate?"
- **Metrics**: "What metrics demonstrate this problem?"

**Best Practice**: Combine both types for maximum credibility:
- Start with soft evidence (testimonials, complaints, observations)
- Support with hard evidence (statistics, analytics, survey results)
- Show the problem is real, measurable, and matters to stakeholders

**Example of combining evidence:**
> "Our customers consistently report frustration with checkout (testimonials). Analytics confirm: 45% abandon checkout, taking 12 minutes on average - 3x longer than industry standard (statistics). Support tickets show 60% of complaints are about checkout complexity (complaints), and our survey found 78% rated it as 'difficult' (survey results)."

**If they don't have evidence yet:**
- That's okay - acknowledge this
- Propose gathering evidence as part of the project
- Use stakeholder conversations as initial evidence
- Reference similar problems in the industry

**Why evidence matters:**
- Stakeholders recognize the problem exists
- The urgency is clear
- Budget approval is easier
- The case for action is compelling
