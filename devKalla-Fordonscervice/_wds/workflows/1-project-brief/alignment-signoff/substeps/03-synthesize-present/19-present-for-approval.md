# Substep 19: Present Alignment Document for Approval

**Purpose**: Present the alignment document and guide next steps

---

## Instruction

**Present the alignment document for review and approval**:

"I've created your alignment document at `docs/1-project-brief/pitch.md`. 

This alignment document is ready to share with your stakeholders. It's designed to be clear, brief, and compelling - readable in just 2-3 minutes.

**Next steps**:
1. Share the alignment document with stakeholders for review
2. Gather their feedback - we can negotiate and make changes
3. Update the alignment document until everyone is on board
4. Once the alignment document is accepted and everyone is aligned on the idea, why, what, how, budget, and commitment
5. **After acceptance**, I'll generate the signoff document (contract/service agreement/signoff) to secure the commitment
6. Then we'll proceed to create the full Project Brief

**Remember**: The alignment phase is collaborative - we can negotiate and iterate until everyone is on the same page. The signoff document comes after acceptance to formalize the commitment. WDS has your back - we'll help you get alignment and secure commitment before starting the work!

Would you like to:
- Review the alignment document together and make any adjustments before sharing?
- Proceed to share it with stakeholders for feedback?
- Make changes based on stakeholder feedback?
- Or something else?"
