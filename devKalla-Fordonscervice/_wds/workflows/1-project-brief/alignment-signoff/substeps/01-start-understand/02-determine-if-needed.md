# Substep 02: Determine If Alignment & Signoff Is Needed

**Purpose**: Determine if user needs alignment & signoff or can proceed directly

---

## Instruction

Based on the user's situation, determine the path:

**If they need alignment & signoff** (consultant, business owner, manager/employee):

"Good. We're going to work together to create an alignment document that presents your idea clearly and gets stakeholders aligned.

This alignment document will help you get alignment on your idea, why it matters, what it contains, how it will be executed, the budget needed, and the commitment required. We can iterate until everyone is on board. Once they accept it, we'll create a signoff document to secure the commitment, then proceed to the full Project Brief.

You can start anywhere - with something you've realized needs attention, or with a solution you have in mind. I'll guide us through the important questions in whatever order makes sense for your thinking."

**If they're doing it themselves** (don't need alignment & signoff):

"That's great! If you have full autonomy and don't need stakeholder alignment, you can skip alignment & signoff and go straight to the Project Brief workflow. Would you like me to help you start the Project Brief instead?"
