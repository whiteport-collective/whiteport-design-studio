## Instruction

Ask the user to clarify their situation:

"I'd like to understand your situation first. This will help me guide you efficiently.

**Are you:**
- A consultant proposing a solution to a client?
- A business owner hiring consultants/suppliers to build software?
- A manager or employee seeking approval for an internal project?
- Or doing this yourself and don't need stakeholder alignment?

Let's get clear on what you need so we can move forward."
