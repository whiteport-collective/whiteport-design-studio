# Substep 13: Explore The Value We'll Create

**Purpose**: Help user articulate what happens if we DO build this

---

## Instruction

Explore the value we'll create.

**Reference**: `src/modules/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/section-guide.md` (Section 7: The Value We'll Create)

**Questions to explore**:
- "What's our ambition? What are we striving to accomplish?"
- "What happens if we DO build this?"
- "What benefits would we see?"
- "What outcomes are we expecting?"
- "How will we measure success?"
- "What metrics will tell us we're succeeding?"
- "What's the value we'd create?"

**Best Practice: Frame as Positive Assumption with Success Metrics**

**Help them articulate**:
- **Our Ambition**: What we're confidently striving to accomplish (enthusiastic, positive)
- **Success Metrics**: How we'll measure success (specific, measurable)
- **What Success Looks Like**: Clear outcomes (tangible results)
- **Monitoring Approach**: How we'll track these metrics (brief)

**Keep it brief** - Key benefits, outcomes, and success metrics

**Help them think**: Positive assumption ("We're confident this will work") + clear success metrics ("Here's how we'll measure it") = enthusiastic and scientific
