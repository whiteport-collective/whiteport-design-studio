# Substep 30: Build Section 9 - Work Initiation

**Purpose**: Build the Work Initiation section

---

## Instruction

**Section 9: Work Initiation**

**Background**: Specifies exactly when work can begin

**What it does**: Defines start date or conditions before work begins

**Purpose**: Prevents unauthorized work, establishes timeline, protects both parties

**Why this matters**:
- Without this clause, work might begin before contract is fully executed
- Prevents disputes about when work actually started
- Protects contractor from doing unpaid work
- Protects client from unauthorized charges
- Establishes clear timeline expectations

**User options**:
- **Upon contract signing**: Work begins immediately when both parties sign
- **Specific date**: Work begins on a set calendar date
- **After initial payment**: Work begins when first payment/deposit is received
- **After written notice**: Work begins when client sends written authorization
- **Conditional start**: Work begins after specific conditions are met (e.g., materials received, approvals obtained)

**What to ask user**: "When should work begin? Options: immediately upon signing, a specific date, after initial payment, or when you give written notice?"

**Content**: Ask user when work should begin, document the chosen option clearly
