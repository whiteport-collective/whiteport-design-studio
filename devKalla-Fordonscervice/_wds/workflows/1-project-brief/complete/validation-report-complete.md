# Validation Report: Complete (Stray Workflow File)

**Validation Started:** 2026-01-22
**Validator:** Wendy - BMAD Workflow Validation System
**Standards Version:** BMAD v6 Workflow Standards

---

## Classification

**Type:** Stray/Misplaced Workflow File
**Status:** Broken - references non-existent steps

---

## File Structure

### Current Structure

```
1-project-brief/complete/
└── workflow.md (61 lines) ❌ References missing steps/
```

**Missing:** No steps/ or steps-c/ folder exists

---

## Issue Analysis

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Broken References

**Problem:** workflow.md references steps that don't exist

**Line 58 references:**
```
{project-root}/{bmad_folder}/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/complete/steps/step-01-init.md
```

**Reality:** No steps/ folder exists in this location

**Impact:** Workflow is completely broken and cannot execute

---

## Structural Confusion

### Duplicate "complete" Folders

**Two complete folders exist:**

1. **1-project-brief/complete/** ← This one (broken)
   - Only has workflow.md
   - References non-existent steps/
   - Appears to be stray file

2. **1-project-brief/project-brief/complete/** ← The real one
   - Has workflow.md
   - Has steps-c/ folder
   - Has proper structure
   - Already validated (separate report)

**Analysis:**
This appears to be a duplicate or misplaced workflow.md file at the wrong directory level.

---

## Recommended Action

### Option A: Delete (Recommended)

**Action:** Remove 1-project-brief/complete/ folder entirely

**Rationale:**
- The real workflow is at 1-project-brief/project-brief/complete/
- This file references paths that don't exist
- Appears to be accidental duplicate
- Causes confusion

### Option B: Fix References

**Action:** Update references to point to correct location

**Change line 58 from:**
```
/1-project-brief/complete/steps/step-01-init.md
```

**To:**
```
/1-project-brief/project-brief/complete/steps-c/01-init.md
```

**But:** This would just create a redundant entry point to the same workflow

---

## Summary

**Validation Date:** 2026-01-22
**Content Type:** Stray Workflow File
**Overall Status:** ❌ **FAIL - Broken and Redundant**

### Key Findings

**❌ Broken Workflow:**
- References non-existent steps/ folder
- Cannot execute
- Completely non-functional

**❌ Structural Issue:**
- Duplicate "complete" folder at wrong level
- Real workflow is at 1-project-brief/project-brief/complete/
- This appears to be misplaced file

**🎯 Conclusion:**
This is a **stray workflow file** that should be **deleted**. The functional workflow exists at the correct location (1-project-brief/project-brief/complete/).

**Recommended Action:**
Delete 1-project-brief/complete/ folder

**Priority:** Low - Doesn't affect functional workflows, but causes confusion
