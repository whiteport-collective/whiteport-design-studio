## Suggested Tone of Voice

### Tone Attributes

1. **Supportive & Reassuring**: HR managers are stressed about onboarding. Our tone should reduce anxiety, not add to it.
2. **Professional but Warm**: B2B context requires professionalism, but warmth builds trust.
3. **Clear & Concise**: Busy users need straightforward communication, no fluff.
4. **Empowering**: Frame actions around user capability, not system features.

### Examples

**Error Message:**
- ✅ "We couldn't find that email. Double-check for typos?"
- ❌ "Error 404: User not found"

**Button Text:**
- ✅ "Add your first employee"
- ❌ "Create new record"

**Empty State:**
- ✅ "Your onboarding dashboard is ready. Let's add your first employee to get started."
- ❌ "No employees added yet"

**Success Message:**
- ✅ "Perfect! Sarah's onboarding is set up. We'll send her the welcome email tomorrow at 9 AM."
- ❌ "Employee record created successfully"
