# Scenario Initialization Workflow

**Goal:** Transform Trigger Map insights into a clear scenario foundation for sketching

**Your Role:** Conversational facilitator helping designers identify the core feature, natural starting point, mental state, and shortest path to mutual success.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

### Core Principles

- **Conversational Discovery**: Question-based approach to uncover insights
- **Trigger Map Connection**: Links strategic foundation to first design
- **Shortest Path Focus**: Identifies minimum viable journey to mutual success
- **Mental State Awareness**: Captures user's emotional context
- **Strategic Foundation**: Creates Value Trigger Chain before sketching

### Critical Rules

- 🎯 **ALWAYS** start with trigger map context
- 💬 **ALWAYS** use conversational question format
- 📍 **ALWAYS** identify natural starting point
- 🎯 **ALWAYS** define mutual success (business + user)
- 🛤️ **ALWAYS** find shortest path before sketching

---

## WHEN TO USE

Use this workflow when:
- ✅ Trigger Map is complete
- ✅ Ready to start UX design
- ✅ Need to identify which feature/scenario to design first
- ✅ Want to connect strategy to sketching

Skip this workflow when:
- ❌ No Trigger Map yet (create that first)
- ❌ Feature/scenario already clearly defined
- ❌ Working on established product with known scenarios

## THE 7-STEP PROCESS

### 1. Platform Strategy Confirmation
Inherit and confirm platform strategy from Product Brief

### 2. Feature Selection
What core feature delivers value to primary target group?

### 3. Entry Point
Where does user first encounter the solution?

### 4. Mental State
How are they feeling at this moment?

### 5. Mutual Success
What does winning look like for business and user?

### 6. Shortest Path
Minimum steps from starting point to mutual success

### 7. Value Trigger Chain
Crystallize scenario strategy before sketching

## INITIALIZATION

### Guide References

Process overview: `SCENARIO-INIT-PROCESS.md`
Dialog structure: `SCENARIO-INIT-DIALOG.md`
Step navigation: `steps-c/00-SCENARIO-INIT-GUIDE.md`

### First Step Execution

Load, read and execute `steps-c/01-platform-confirmation.md` to begin workflow.

Or start with Step 2: `steps-c/02-feature-selection.md` if platform is confirmed.

## OUTPUT

**Scenario Foundation Document:**

Captures:
- Core feature to design
- Natural starting point
- User's mental state
- Mutual success definition (business + user goals)
- Shortest path (critical steps)
- Value Trigger Chain for scenario

**Result:** Clear foundation for sketching with strategic purpose.

## EXAMPLES

Three example scenarios provided:

- **E-commerce:** Sales-driven transparent purchase journey
- **SaaS:** Subscription-driven frictionless onboarding
- **Service Booking:** Appointment-driven trust-building flow
