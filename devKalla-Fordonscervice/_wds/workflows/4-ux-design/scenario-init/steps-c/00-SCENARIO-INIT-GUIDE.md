# Scenario Initialization Guide

**From Trigger Map to first sketch**

## Purpose

You've created your Trigger Map. Now: **What should you start sketching?**

This process helps you identify:

- The core feature to design first
- The natural starting point
- The user's mental state
- The shortest path to mutual success

Where does the user first come into contact with your solution?

### [4. What's Their Mental State?](04-mental-state.md)

How are they feeling at this moment?

### [5. What's Mutual Success?](05-mutual-success.md)

### [6. What's the Shortest Path?](06-shortest-path.md)
