<output>**Ready for Phase 3: Platform Requirements!** ⚔️

**To begin Platform Requirements with Idunn:**

**Option 1: Activate Idunn**
```
Load: agent-activation/wds-idunn-pm.md
```

**Option 2: Direct Workflow**
```
Load: workflows/3-prd-platform/instructions.md
```

Idunn will review your UX designs and guide you through platform analysis.

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours

**What You'll Create:**
- Platform architecture document
- Data model specifications
- API endpoint definitions
- Technical constraints documentation
- Third-party service requirements

**Note:** Platform Requirements can also be done BEFORE UX Design if you prefer to establish technical constraints first. We're doing it after because your designs inform what's needed.

Would you like to proceed to Platform Requirements now, or take a break and continue later?</output>
