# Assessment Step 4: Identify Opportunities

**Purpose:** Identify potential benefits of different design system decisions.

**Input:** Similarity analysis and comparison data

**Output:** List of opportunities for each option

---

## Decision Options

For each similar component, there are 3 options:

### Option 1: Reuse Existing Component

Use the existing component reference, just change content

### Option 2: Add Variant to Existing

Extend existing component with new variant

### Option 3: Create New Component

Create separate component in design system

---

## Opportunity Analysis Framework

### For Option 1: Reuse Existing

**Potential Opportunities:**

#### Consistency

- ✅ Visual consistency across pages
- ✅ Behavioral consistency (same interactions)
- ✅ User familiarity (looks/works the same)
- ✅ Brand coherence

#### Maintenance

- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Update once, applies everywhere
- ✅ Easier to maintain
- ✅ Fewer files to manage

#### Development

- ✅ Faster development (component exists)
- ✅ Less code duplication
- ✅ Easier testing (test once)
- ✅ Better performance (reused code)

#### Design System

- ✅ Cleaner design system
- ✅ Fewer components to document
- ✅ Easier for developers to find
- ✅ Simpler component library

---

### For Option 2: Add Variant

**Potential Opportunities:**

#### Flexibility

- ✅ Accommodates different use cases
- ✅ Maintains component family
- ✅ Allows contextual adaptation
- ✅ Supports design evolution

#### Consistency

- ✅ Related components stay connected
- ✅ Shared base styling
- ✅ Consistent naming pattern
- ✅ Clear component relationships

#### Scalability

- ✅ Easy to add more variants later
- ✅ Supports design system growth
- ✅ Handles edge cases gracefully
- ✅ Accommodates future needs

#### Documentation

- ✅ Variants documented together
- ✅ Clear component family
- ✅ Easier to understand relationships
- ✅ Better developer guidance

---

### For Option 3: Create New

**Potential Opportunities:**

#### Clarity

- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Distinct purpose/function
- ✅ No confusion about usage
- ✅ Semantic clarity

#### Simplicity

- ✅ Simpler component definition
- ✅ No complex variant logic
- ✅ Easier to understand
- ✅ Fewer edge cases

#### Independence

- ✅ Can evolve independently
- ✅ No impact on other components
- ✅ Easier to modify
- ✅ No unintended side effects

#### Specificity

- ✅ Optimized for specific use case
- ✅ No unnecessary features
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Clearer developer intent

## Step 1: Analyze Current Situation

<action>
Based on similarity level and comparison, identify which opportunities apply
</action>

**Example (72% similarity):**

```
Current Situation:
- High visual similarity
- Different functional purpose (navigation vs submission)
- Some behavioral differences (loading state, icon)
- Similar usage context

Applicable Opportunities:
- Reuse: Consistency, maintenance benefits
- Variant: Flexibility, maintains family
- New: Clarity of purpose, independence
```

---

## Step 2: Generate Opportunity Lists

<output>
**Option 1: Reuse Button [btn-001]**

Opportunities:
✅ **Consistency:** All buttons look and behave the same
✅ **Maintenance:** Update button styling once, applies everywhere
✅ **Simplicity:** Fewer components in design system
✅ **Development:** Faster implementation (component exists)

Best if: Visual consistency is more important than functional distinction
</output>

<output>
**Option 2: Add "Navigation" Variant to Button [btn-001]**

Opportunities:
✅ **Flexibility:** Supports both submission and navigation use cases
✅ **Family:** Keeps related buttons together
✅ **Scalability:** Easy to add more button types later
✅ **Documentation:** All button variants in one place

Best if: You want to maintain button family but need different behaviors
</output>

<output>
**Option 3: Create New "Navigation Button" Component**

Opportunities:
✅ **Clarity:** Clear distinction between submission and navigation
✅ **Semantics:** Developers understand purpose immediately
✅ **Independence:** Can evolve without affecting submit buttons
✅ **Optimization:** Tailored for navigation use case

Best if: Functional distinction is more important than visual consistency
</output>

---

## Step 3: Highlight Strongest Opportunities

<action>
Based on comparison data, identify the most compelling opportunities for each option
</action>

**Example:**

```
🌟 Strongest Opportunities:

**For Reuse:**
- Your buttons are 90% visually identical
- Consistency would be very strong
- Maintenance would be significantly easier

**For Variant:**
- You have 2 distinct button purposes emerging
- Variant structure would accommodate both
- Future button types could fit this pattern

**For New:**
- Navigation and submission are semantically different
- Developers would benefit from clear distinction
- Each could evolve independently as needs change
```

---

## Step 4: Consider Project Context

<action>
Factor in project-specific considerations:
- Design system maturity (new vs established)
- Team size (solo vs large team)
- Project complexity (simple vs complex)
- Timeline (fast vs thorough)
</action>

**Example:**

```
📋 Project Context:

Design System: New (3 components so far)
Team: Small (2-3 people)
Complexity: Medium
Timeline: Moderate

Context-Specific Opportunities:
- **New design system:** Easier to keep simple (favors reuse/variant)
- **Small team:** Fewer components = easier maintenance (favors reuse)
- **Medium complexity:** Room for some structure (favors variant)
```

---

## Step 5: Pass to Next Step

<action>
Pass opportunity analysis to risk identification:
- Opportunities for each option
- Strongest opportunities
- Context considerations
</action>

## Edge Cases

**All options have strong opportunities:**

```
✨ All Options Look Good!

Each approach has compelling opportunities:
- Reuse: Strong consistency benefits
- Variant: Good balance of flexibility
- New: Clear semantic distinction

This means the risks will be the deciding factor.
```

**No clear opportunities:**

```
⚠️ No Strong Opportunities Identified

This might mean:
- Components are too different to benefit from connection
- Or too similar to benefit from separation

I'll focus on risks to help clarify the decision.
```

**Conflicting opportunities:**

```
⚠️ Conflicting Opportunities

Reuse offers consistency, but New offers clarity.
These are competing values.

Your design philosophy will guide this decision:
- Value consistency? → Reuse
- Value semantics? → New
```
