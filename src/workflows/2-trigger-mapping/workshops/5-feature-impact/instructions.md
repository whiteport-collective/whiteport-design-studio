Now we create a **Design Brief** - strategic guidance for the designer on which features matter most and to whom.

This workshop will:
1. Extract features from your project documentation
2. Allow you to review and adjust the feature list
3. Make an initial impact assessment
4. Allow you to review and refine the assessment
5. Generate the prioritized Feature Impact document

This workshop is optional but highly valuable for strategic clarity.</output>
