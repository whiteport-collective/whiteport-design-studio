# Trigger Mapping Phase - Review Findings

**Date:** December 27, 2025  
**Reviewer:** Saga (via User Request)  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## Issues Found and Resolved

### ✅ 1. Main Instructions Missing Workshop 5 Reference

**File:** `instructions.md` (main trigger mapping orchestrator)  
**Issue:** Step 6 mentions only 5 workshops in intro, but documentation section doesn't reference Workshop 5 (Feature Impact)

**FIXED:**
- Updated intro to list 4 core workshops + 1 optional (Feature Impact)
- Added Step 5.5 as optional Feature Impact workshop call
- User is asked if they want to run Feature Impact before handover
- Removed old "Step 6: Documentation" in favor of handover workflow

**Impact:** Medium - Users don't know Feature Impact workshop exists  
**Resolution:** ✅ Complete

---

### ✅ 2. Inconsistent Workshop Numbering

**Issue:** Main instructions lists workshops 1-5 but "Documentation" is workflow step 6, while Feature Impact is Workshop 5

**FIXED:**
- Clarified structure: 4 core workshops (1-4)
- Feature Impact is optional Workshop 5
- Documentation generation moved to handover workflow
- Clear separation between workshops and documentation

**Impact:** Low - Confusing but functional  
**Resolution:** ✅ Complete

---

### ✅ 3. Project-Specific Examples in Generic Instructions

**Files:** Multiple instruction and template files contained WDS-specific examples
**Issue:** Generic workflow should use neutral, reusable examples - not tied to any specific project

**FIXED:**
- Removed WDS-specific transformation example ("designers from overwhelmed...")
- Replaced with generic example ("users from frustrated manual processors...")
- Changed "adapted by WDS" to "adapted for WDS framework"
- Changed "Generated by Whiteport Design Studio" to "Generated with Whiteport Design Studio framework"
- Removed specific example path references
- Made all handover language role-based ("UX Designer" with agent name in parentheses)
- Battle Cry remains only in WDS example documentation (where it belongs)

**Impact:** Low - Instructions are now project-agnostic and reusable  
**Resolution:** ✅ Complete - All examples are now generic and framework-focused

---

### ✅ 4. Feature Impact Not in Main Flow

**File:** `instructions.md` (main)  
**Issue:** Feature Impact workshop exists but isn't loaded in main workflow

**FIXED:**
- Added Step 5.5 (optional) to main workflow
- Asks user if they want to run Feature Impact
- If yes: loads workshop instructions
- If no: proceeds to handover with note that it can be run later

**Impact:** High - Feature is hidden  
**Resolution:** ✅ Complete

---

### ✅ 5. Link Format Inconsistency

**Files:** Mermaid diagram instructions  
**Issue:** Uses markdown link to step file, but should just load directly like others

**FIXED:**
- Removed markdown link format
- Changed to BMad v6 format with `<workflow>` tag
- Uses `<action>Load and execute:` format
- Consistent with other workflows

**Impact:** Low - Still works but inconsistent with other workflows  
**Resolution:** ✅ Complete

---

### ✅ 6. No Clear Entry Point for Feature Impact

**Issue:** Feature Impact workshop has no parent that loads it

**FIXED:**
- Main instructions now include Step 5.5 (optional)
- User is explicitly asked if they want to run it
- Clear entry point before documentation/handover
- Can also be run standalone if needed

**Impact:** High - Usability issue  
**Resolution:** ✅ Complete

---

## Additional Improvements Made

### ✅ 7. Handover Workflow Integration

**Added:**
- Trigger Mapping now ends with handover workflow, not raw documentation
- Handover calls document generation internally
- Adds cross-references
- Performs quality check
- Creates handover package for Freya
- Provides activation instructions

**Benefit:** Clean phase transition with proper context for next agent

---

### ✅ 8. Incremental UX Handover Pattern

**Updated:**
- UX Design handover supports MULTIPLE calls (not one-time)
- Can hand off per scenario, per page, or per flow segment
- Enables continuous delivery (design + development in parallel)
- Tracks deliveries in log file
- Provides activation for each delivery

**Benefit:** True agile workflow with small, frequent deliveries
