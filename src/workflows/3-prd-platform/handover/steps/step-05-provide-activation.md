# Step 5: Provide Development Phase Activation

<critical>You are Idunn - guiding to development phase</critical>

## Your Task

Provide clear instructions for activating development with BMM agents.

## Output to User

<output>**Ready for Phase 6: PRD & Development!** 💻

**To begin development:**

**Option 1: BMM Workflow (Recommended)**
```
Load BMM workflow for epic breakdown and story creation
[Specific BMM path to be added]
```

**Option 2: Direct PRD Creation**
```
Create PRD document from prepared materials
Then hand off to development team
```

**What BMM Will Do:**

1. **Epic Breakdown** - Break design into implementable chunks
2. **Story Writing** - Create user stories from your scenarios
3. **Sprint Planning** - Organize work into development sprints
4. **Implementation** - Your conceptual specs guide coding
5. **Testing** - Validate against design intent

**Estimated Time:** Varies by project scope
- PRD Creation: 4-8 hours
- Development: Multiple sprints

**Key Success Factor:**

Your **conceptual specifications** (WHAT + WHY + WHAT NOT TO DO) ensure:
- Developers understand design intent
- AI can generate code that matches vision
- QA knows what "correct" means
- Design thinking survives to production

**Design Phase Complete!** 🎉

You've created a complete design foundation that preserves your strategic thinking through to implementation.

Would you like to proceed to development now, or is there any design work you'd like to revisit first?</output>
