### Payment Terms

**Total Agreement Amount**: {{total_amount}}

**Payment Structure**: {{payment_structure}}

**Payment Schedule**:
{{payment_schedule}}

**Background**: Clear payment terms protect both parties and ensure fair compensation.

**What it does**: Defines when and how payments will be made.

**Purpose**: 
- Ensures service provider receives fair compensation for work
- Provides client with clear payment expectations
- Protects both parties from payment disputes
- For fixed-price agreements, upfront payment is fair since service provider assumes cost overrun risk

**Payment Terms Details**:
- **Payment Method**: {{payment_method}} (check, wire transfer, credit card, etc.)
- **Payment Due Dates**: {{payment_due_dates}}
- **Late Payment**: {{late_payment_terms}} (e.g., interest charges, work suspension)
- **Payment Conditions**: {{payment_conditions}} (e.g., payment required before work begins, payment tied to deliverables)

**For Fixed-Price Agreements**: 
This is a fixed-price agreement, meaning the service provider commits to deliver specified work for the agreed price, regardless of actual costs. Since the service provider assumes the risk of cost overruns, upfront payment (50-100%) is standard and fair. This demonstrates client commitment and enables the service provider to deliver quality work without cash flow concerns.
