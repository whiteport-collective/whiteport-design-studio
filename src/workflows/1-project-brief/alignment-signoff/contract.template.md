### Payment Terms

**Total Contract Amount**: {{total_amount}}

**Payment Structure**: {{payment_structure}}

**Payment Schedule**:
{{payment_schedule}}

**Background**: Clear payment terms protect both parties and ensure fair compensation.

**What it does**: Defines when and how payments will be made.

**Purpose**: 
- Ensures supplier receives fair compensation for work
- Provides client with clear payment expectations
- Protects both parties from payment disputes
- For fixed-price contracts, upfront payment is fair since supplier assumes cost overrun risk

**Payment Terms Details**:
- **Payment Method**: {{payment_method}} (check, wire transfer, credit card, etc.)
- **Payment Due Dates**: {{payment_due_dates}}
- **Late Payment**: {{late_payment_terms}} (e.g., interest charges, work suspension)
- **Payment Conditions**: {{payment_conditions}} (e.g., payment required before work begins, payment tied to deliverables)

**For Fixed-Price Contracts**: 
This is a fixed-price contract, meaning the contractor commits to deliver specified work for the agreed price, regardless of actual costs. Since the contractor assumes the risk of cost overruns, upfront payment (50-100%) is standard and fair. This demonstrates client commitment and enables the contractor to deliver quality work without cash flow concerns.
