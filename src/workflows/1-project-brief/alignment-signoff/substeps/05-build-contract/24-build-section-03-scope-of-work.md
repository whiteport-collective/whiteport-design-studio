# Substep 24: Build Section 3 - Scope of Work

**Purpose**: Build the Scope of Work section with IN scope, OUT of scope, and deliverables

---

## Instruction

**Section 3: Scope of Work**

**Background**: Defines exactly what will be delivered and what won't be

**What it does**: Lists path forward, deliverables, explicit IN scope, and explicit OUT of scope

**Purpose**: Prevents scope creep and sets clear boundaries - critical for avoiding disputes

**Why this matters**:
- Most contract disputes arise from unclear scope
- Clear IN/OUT scope prevents misunderstandings
- Protects both parties from scope creep
- Sets expectations upfront

**Content to gather**:
1. **The Path Forward**: Pull from alignment document (path_forward) - how the work will be done
2. **Deliverables**: Pull from alignment document (deliverables_list) - what will be delivered
3. **IN Scope**: Ask user explicitly - "What work is explicitly included? Be specific about what's covered."
4. **OUT of Scope**: Ask user explicitly - "What work is explicitly NOT included? What would require a change order?"

**Important**: Based on business model, adapt scope section:
- **Fixed-Price**: Must have very clear IN scope and OUT of scope (critical for fixed-price - this protects both parties)
- **Hourly**: Can be more flexible, but still define boundaries to prevent misunderstandings
- **Retainer**: Define what types of work are included in retainer vs. project work
- **Hybrid**: Define scope for each component separately

**What to ask user**:
- "Let's be very clear about what's included and what's not. What work is explicitly IN scope for this contract?"
- "What work is explicitly OUT of scope? What would require a change order?"
- "Are there any assumptions about what's included that we should document?"
