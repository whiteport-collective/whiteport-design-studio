# Substep 27: Build Section 6 - Availability (Retainer Only)

**Purpose**: Build Availability section for retainer contracts

---

## Instruction

**Section 6: Availability** (Only for Retainer model)

**Background**: Defines when contractor is available for retainer work

**What it does**: Sets expectations for response times, working hours, availability windows

**Purpose**: Ensures client knows when they can expect work to be done

**Why this matters**:
- Retainer clients need to know when contractor is available
- Sets realistic expectations for response times
- Prevents misunderstandings about availability

**What to include**:
- **Business hours**: {{business_hours}} (e.g., "Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm EST")
- **Response time**: {{response_time}} (e.g., "2-3 business days for non-urgent requests")
- **Availability for meetings**: {{meeting_availability}} (e.g., "Available for scheduled calls during business hours")
- **Urgent requests**: {{urgent_request_policy}} (e.g., "Urgent requests may incur additional fees")

**What to ask user**: "What availability expectations do you have? What response times work for you?"

**Content**: Define availability expectations based on retainer agreement
