# Substep 28: Build Section 7 - Confidentiality Clause

**Purpose**: Build the Confidentiality clause

---

## Instruction

**Section 7: Confidentiality Clause**

**Background**: Protects sensitive information shared during the project

**What it does**: Requires both parties to keep project information confidential

**Purpose**: Protects proprietary information, business strategies, and trade secrets - mutual protection builds trust

**Why this matters**: 
- Without this clause, either party could share sensitive project details with competitors
- Protects your business secrets, customer data, and strategic plans
- Builds trust by showing mutual respect for confidentiality
- Prevents legal disputes about information sharing

**User options**:
- **Standard confidentiality** (recommended): Both parties keep all project information confidential
- **Limited confidentiality**: Only specific information types are confidential (e.g., financial data only)
- **One-way confidentiality**: Only one party is bound (rare, usually for public projects)
- **Duration**: How long confidentiality lasts (typically 2-5 years, or indefinitely for trade secrets)
- **Exceptions**: What's NOT confidential (public info, independently developed, required by law)

**What to ask user**: "Do you have sensitive information that needs protection? How long should confidentiality last? (Typically 2-5 years)"

**Content**: Standard confidentiality language (see template), customized based on user choices

**Fairness note**: "This protects both parties equally - your sensitive info stays private, and I'm protected too"
