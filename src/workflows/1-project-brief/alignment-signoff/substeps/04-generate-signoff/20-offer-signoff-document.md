# Substep 20: Offer to Generate Signoff Document

**Purpose**: Offer to create signoff document after alignment acceptance

---

## Instruction

**After the alignment document is accepted by stakeholders**, offer to create a signoff document:

"Great! The alignment document has been accepted and everyone is aligned on the idea, why, what, how, budget, and commitment. 

Now let's secure this commitment with a signoff document. This will formalize what everyone has agreed to and ensure everyone stays committed to making this project happen.

**What type of document do you need?**

1. **Project Contract** - If you're a consultant and the client has approved the alignment document
2. **Service Agreement** - If you're a founder/owner and suppliers have approved the alignment document
3. **Project Signoff Document** - If this is an internal company project and stakeholders have approved
   - *Note: If you have an existing company signoff document format, you can upload it and I'll adapt it to match your company's format*
4. **Skip** - If you don't need a formal document right now

Which applies to your situation?

**Remember**: WDS helps with alignment - the alignment document got everyone on the same page, and this signoff document secures the commitment before we start building something that makes the world a better place!"

## Decision Point

**If user chooses "Skip"**:
- Acknowledge: "No problem! The alignment document is ready to share. You can always generate a signoff document later if needed."
- Proceed to Project Brief workflow

**If user chooses document type**:
→ `21-determine-business-model.md` (same folder - for external contracts)
→ `../06-build-signoff-internal/34-build-internal-signoff.md` (for internal signoff)
