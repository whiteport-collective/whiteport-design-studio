# Substep 05: Detect Starting Point

**Purpose**: Determine where the user wants to start exploring sections

---

## Instruction

Ask where they'd like to start:

"Where would you like to start? Have you realized something that needs attention, or do you have a solution in mind?"

---

## Decision Point

**If user starts with realization**:
- Explore the realization first
- Then naturally move to "why it matters" and "who we help"
- Then explore solutions
→ `../02-explore-sections/06-explore-realization.md`

**If user starts with solution**:
- Capture the solution idea
- Then explore "what realization does this address?"
- Then explore "why it matters" and "who we help"
- Then explore other possible approaches
→ `../02-explore-sections/07-explore-solution.md`

**If user starts elsewhere**:
- Follow their lead
- Guide them through remaining sections naturally
→ Route to appropriate section exploration micro-instruction
