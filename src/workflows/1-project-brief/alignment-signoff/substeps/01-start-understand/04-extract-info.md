## Instruction

Extract relevant information from the communications/documents:

**What to extract**:
- **Realizations mentioned** - What have stakeholders realized or observed?
- **Requirements discussed** - What do they need or want?
- **Concerns raised** - What questions or concerns have they expressed?
- **Context** - Background information about the project
- **Timeline or urgency** - Any deadlines or time-sensitive information
- **Budget or constraints** - Financial or resource limitations mentioned

**Use extracted information**:
- Inform The Realization section (what realizations or observations are mentioned)
- Inform Why It Matters (who is experiencing issues and why it matters)
- Inform Our Commitment (any budget/resource discussions)
- Inform Cost of Inaction (any urgency or consequences mentioned)
- Add context throughout the alignment document

**Don't**:
- Copy entire communications or documents verbatim
- Include personal or irrelevant details
- Overwhelm with too much detail
- Use information that's clearly outdated
- Include sensitive information that shouldn't be in the alignment document
