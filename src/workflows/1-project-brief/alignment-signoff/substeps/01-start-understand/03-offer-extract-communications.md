# Substep 03: Offer to Extract Information from Communications

**Purpose**: Offer optional step to extract information from existing communications/documents

---

## Instruction

Ask if they have relevant communications or documents:

"Do you have any email threads, chat conversations, documents, or other materials from clients or stakeholders about this project? 

If you do, I can extract key information from them - things like:
- Realizations or observations they've mentioned
- Requirements they've discussed
- Concerns or questions they've raised
- Context about the project
- Existing documentation or specifications

This can help us create a more informed alignment document. You can paste the content here, share the communications, or upload documents, and I'll extract the relevant information."

## Decision Point

**If user provides communications/documents**:
→ `04-extract-info.md` (same folder)

**If user doesn't have any or skips**:
→ `05-detect-starting-point.md` (same folder)
