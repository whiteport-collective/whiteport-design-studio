# Substep 15: Explore Our Commitment

**Purpose**: Help user articulate resources needed and potential risks

---

## Instruction

Explore our commitment.

**Reference**: `src/modules/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/section-guide.md` (Section 9: Our Commitment)

**Questions to explore**:
- "What resources are we committing?"
- "What's the time commitment?"
- "What budget or team are we committing?"
- "What dependencies exist?"
- "What potential risks or drawbacks should we consider?"
- "What challenges might we face?"

**Keep it brief** - High-level commitment and potential risks

**Don't force precision** - Rough estimates are fine at this stage

**Help them think**: Time, money, people, technology - what are we committing to make this happen? What risks or challenges should we acknowledge?
