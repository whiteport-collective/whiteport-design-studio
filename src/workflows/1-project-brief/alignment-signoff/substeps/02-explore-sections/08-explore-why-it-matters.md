## Instruction

Explore why it matters and who we help.

**Reference**: `src/modules/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/section-guide.md` (Section 2: Why It Matters)

**Questions to explore**:
- "Why does this matter?"
- "Who are we helping?"
- "What are they trying to accomplish?" (Jobs)
- "What are their pain points?" (Pains)
- "What would make their life better?" (Gains)
- "How does this affect them?"
- "What impact will this have?"
- "Are there different groups we're helping?"

**Keep it brief** - Why it matters and who we help

**Help them think**: Focus on the value we're adding to specific people and why that matters
