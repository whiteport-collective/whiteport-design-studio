# Substep 10: Explore Paths We Explored

**Purpose**: Help user articulate alternative approaches they considered

---

## Instruction

Explore paths they explored.

**Reference**: `src/modules/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/section-guide.md` (Section 4: Paths We Explored)

**Questions to explore**:
- "What other ways could we approach this?"
- "Are there alternative paths?"
- "What options have you considered?"

**Keep it brief** - 2-3 paths explored briefly

**If user only has one path**: That's fine - acknowledge it and move on
