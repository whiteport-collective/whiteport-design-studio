# Substep 12: Explore The Path Forward

**Purpose**: Help user articulate how the work will be done

---

## Instruction

Explore the path forward.

**Reference**: `src/modules/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/section-guide.md` (Section 6: The Path Forward)

**Purpose**: Explain how the work will be done practically - which WDS phases will be used and the workflow approach.

**Questions to explore**:
- "How do you envision the work being done?"
- "Which WDS phases do you think we'll need?"
- "What's the practical workflow you're thinking?"
- "Will we need user research, or do you already know your users?"
- "Do you need technical architecture planning, or is that already defined?"
- "What level of design detail do you need?"
- "How will this be handed off for implementation?"

**Keep it brief** - High-level plan of the work approach

**Help them think**: 
- Which WDS phases apply (Trigger Mapping, Platform Requirements, UX Design, Design System, etc.)
- Practical workflow (research → design → handoff, or skip research, etc.)
- Level of detail needed
- Handoff approach
