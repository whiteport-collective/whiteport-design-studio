# Alignment & Signoff Substeps

**Purpose**: Small, sequential instruction files for the Alignment & Signoff workflow

---

## Overview

These substeps break down the Alignment & Signoff workflow into small, focused steps that agents can follow sequentially. Each substep file contains a single, clear action.

5. `05-detect-starting-point.md` - Detect where user wants to start

### Phase 2: Explore Sections (`02-explore-sections/`) - Flexible Order
6. `06-explore-realization.md` - Explore The Realization
7. `07-explore-solution.md` - Explore Solution (if starting with solution)
8. `08-explore-why-it-matters.md` - Explore Why It Matters
9. `09-explore-how-we-see-it-working.md` - Explore How We See It Working
10. `10-explore-paths-we-explored.md` - Explore Paths We Explored
11. `11-explore-recommended-solution.md` - Explore Recommended Solution
12. `12-explore-path-forward.md` - Explore The Path Forward
13. `13-explore-value-we-create.md` - Explore The Value We'll Create
14. `14-explore-cost-of-inaction.md` - Explore Cost of Inaction
15. `15-explore-our-commitment.md` - Explore Our Commitment
16. `16-explore-summary.md` - Explore Summary

### Phase 3: Synthesize & Present (`03-synthesize-present/`)
17. `17-reflect-back.md` - Reflect back what you've captured
18. `18-synthesize-document.md` - Synthesize into alignment document
19. `19-present-for-approval.md` - Present for stakeholder approval

### Phase 4: Generate Signoff (`04-generate-signoff/`) - After Acceptance
20. `20-offer-signoff-document.md` - Offer to generate signoff document
21. `21-determine-business-model.md` - Determine business model (external contracts)

### Phase 5: Build External Contract (`05-build-contract/`) - If Selected
22. `22-build-section-01-project-overview.md` - Build Project Overview
23. `23-build-section-02-business-model.md` - Build Business Model
24. `24-build-section-03-scope-of-work.md` - Build Scope of Work (IN/OUT scope)
25. `25-build-section-04-payment-terms.md` - Build Payment Terms
26. `26-build-section-05-timeline.md` - Build Timeline
27. `27-build-section-06-availability.md` - Build Availability (Retainer only)
28. `28-build-section-07-confidentiality.md` - Build Confidentiality
29. `29-build-section-08-not-to-exceed.md` - Build Not-to-Exceed (Conditional)
30. `30-build-section-09-work-initiation.md` - Build Work Initiation
31. `31-build-section-10-terms-and-conditions.md` - Build Terms and Conditions
32. `32-build-section-11-approval.md` - Build Approval
33. `33-finalize-contract.md` - Finalize contract

### Phase 6: Build Internal Signoff (`06-build-signoff-internal/`) - If Selected
34. `34-build-internal-signoff.md` - Build Internal Signoff Document
35. `35-finalize-signoff.md` - Finalize signoff document

## Usage

**For agents**: Follow these substeps sequentially. Each file contains a single, focused instruction with clear next steps.

**Decision points**: Some substeps have decision points that route to different next steps based on user choices.

**Flexible flow**: Section exploration (substeps 06-16) can be done in any order based on user's natural thinking flow.

## Key Principles

- **One instruction per file**: Each substep focuses on a single action
- **Clear next steps**: Each file specifies what comes next
- **Decision points**: Route to different paths based on user choices
- **Reference larger guides**: Substeps reference section-guide.md for detailed guidance
- **Linear flow**: Follow sequentially, but allow flexibility in section exploration order
