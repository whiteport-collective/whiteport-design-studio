# Step 3: Synthesize Alignment Document

## Purpose

Crystallize all explored sections into a clear, compelling alignment document (pitch).

---

## Instruction

**After covering all sections** (in whatever order made sense):

1. **Reflect back** what you've captured
2. **Help crystallize** into a clear, compelling narrative using framework thinking:
   - **Realization → Why It Matters → How We See It Working → Value We'll Create**
   - **Realization → Agitate (Cost of Inaction) → Solve (Solution) → Commitment**
3. **Ask**: "Does this capture your alignment document? Anything you'd like to adjust?"
4. **Confirm**: "Does this present your idea in the best light?"

**Framework check**: Does the alignment document flow logically?
- Realization is clear and evidence-backed
- Why it matters and who we help is understood
- Solution addresses the realization
- Commitment is reasonable and risks acknowledged
- Cost of inaction makes the case
- Value we'll create justifies the commitment

## Create Alignment Document

**Output file**: `docs/1-project-brief/pitch.md` (deliverable name: "pitch")

**Format**: Clear, brief, readable in 2-3 minutes

**Structure**: Use the 10-section structure covered in the exploration

**Template reference**: `src/modules/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/pitch.template.md`

---

## Next Step

After creating the pitch document, proceed to:
→ `step-04-present-for-approval.md` (Present pitch for stakeholder review and approval)

**Note**: The agreement document (contract/service agreement/signoff) will be generated AFTER the pitch is approved, allowing for changes and iterations during the pitch phase.
