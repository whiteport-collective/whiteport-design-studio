# Step 1.5: Extract Information from Communications and Documents (Optional)

## Purpose

Gather existing context from client/stakeholder communications, emails, chats, and documents to inform the pitch.

---

## Instruction

**Ask the user** if they have any relevant communications or documents:

"Do you have any email threads, chat conversations, documents, or other materials from clients or stakeholders about this project? 

If you do, I can extract key information from them - things like:
- Realizations or observations they've mentioned
- Requirements they've discussed
- Concerns or questions they've raised
- Context about the project
- Existing documentation or specifications

This can help us create a more informed pitch. You can paste the content here, share the communications, or upload documents, and I'll extract the relevant information."

## If User Provides Communications or Documents

**What to extract**:
- **Realizations mentioned** - What have stakeholders realized or observed?
- **Requirements discussed** - What do they need or want?
- **Concerns raised** - What are their worries or questions?
- **Context** - Background information about the project
- **Stakeholder perspectives** - Different viewpoints or needs
- **Timeline or urgency** - Any deadlines or timing mentioned
- **Budget or constraints** - Any resource limitations discussed
- **Existing specifications** - Any requirements or specs already documented
- **Previous discussions** - Key points from past conversations

**How to extract**:
1. Read through the communications carefully
2. Identify key themes and information
3. Extract relevant details that inform the pitch sections
4. Note any contradictions or different perspectives
5. Summarize findings: "From these communications, I'm seeing..."

**Use extracted information**:
- Inform The Realization section (what realizations or observations are mentioned)
- Inform Why It Matters (who is experiencing issues and why it matters)
- Inform Our Commitment (any budget/resource discussions)
- Inform Cost of Inaction (any urgency or consequences mentioned)
- Add context throughout the pitch

**Don't**:
- Copy entire communications or documents verbatim
- Include personal or irrelevant details
- Overwhelm with too much detail
- Use information that's clearly outdated
- Include sensitive information that shouldn't be in the pitch

## If User Doesn't Have Communications or Documents

**That's fine** - Simply acknowledge and move on:

"No problem! We'll work with what you know. Let's start exploring the project together."

Then proceed to exploring sections.

## Next Step

After extracting information (or if user doesn't have communications), proceed to:

**Note**: Use the extracted information to inform your questions as you explore each section.
