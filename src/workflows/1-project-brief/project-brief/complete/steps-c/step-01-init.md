# Step 1: Welcome and Set Expectations

- Target users (ICP) - who we're designing for
- Success criteria (how we'll measure success)
- Competitive landscape (what alternatives exist)
- Constraints & context (real-world limitations)

## Instructions

Welcome the user and explain that this is their strategic foundation. Set time expectations (30-60 minutes) and ask about any existing context that should be considered.

## Next Step

When user confirms readiness, proceed to step-02-vision.md
