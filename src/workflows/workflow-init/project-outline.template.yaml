  # Status reporting style

# Project-Specific Notes
notes: |
  {{PROJECT_NOTES}}

  Example notes:
  - This is an internal tool, so we're skipping Trigger Mapping (Phase 2)
  - Using shadcn/ui library, so Design System (Phase 5) is minimal
  - MVP focus - Testing (Phase 7) will happen post-launch

# ============================================================================
# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS FILE
# ============================================================================

# During Project Initiation (Saga WDS Analyst Agent):
#
# When creating the Product Brief, walk through each phase and ask about user intentions:
#
# Phase 1: Project Brief (Always included)
# No question - this is where we are now!
#
# Phase 2: Trigger Mapping
# Ask: What are your intentions for Trigger Mapping? This phase helps us identify target users, personas, and business goals.
# Is this a customer-facing product where understanding user triggers is critical? Or an internal tool where we might skip this phase?
#
# Capture: User's answer → {{USER_INTENT_PHASE_2}}
# Decision: Set active: true or active: false based on answer
#
# Phase 3: PRD Platform
# Ask: What are your intentions for technical foundation? Do you already have a tech stack in mind, or do you need help defining architecture, data model, and infrastructure requirements?
#
# Capture: User's answer → {{USER_INTENT_PHASE_3}}
#
# Phase 4: UX Design
# Ask: What are your intentions for UX Design? How many user scenarios or flows do you envision? Are you thinking MVP-focused (2-3 core scenarios) or comprehensive (5+ scenarios)?
#
# Capture: User's answer → {{USER_INTENT_PHASE_4}}
# Note: Also capture estimated scenarios_planned number
#
# Phase 5: Design System
# Ask: What are your intentions for a Design System? Are you:
# - Using an existing component library (shadcn/ui, MUI)?
# - Building custom components?
# - Creating a multi-product design system?
# - Skipping this for MVP?
#
# Capture: User's answer → {{USER_INTENT_PHASE_5}}
# Decision: Set active: false if skipping, add skip_reason
#
# Phase 6: Design Deliveries
# Ask: What are your intentions for design deliveries? Will you be handing off to a development team, or implementing directly from specifications?
#
# Capture: User's answer → {{USER_INTENT_PHASE_6}}
#
# Phase 7: Testing
# Ask: What are your intentions for testing? Do you want to validate implementation against design specs, or handle testing separately?
#
# Capture: User's answer → {{USER_INTENT_PHASE_7}}
#
# Phase 8: Ongoing Development
# Ask: Is this a new product or an existing product needing improvements?
#
# Capture: User's answer → {{USER_INTENT_PHASE_8}}
# Decision: Set active: false for new products
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# On Agent Activation (ALL WDS Agents):
#
# 1. CHECK if .wds-project-outline.yaml exists in docs/ or project root
# 2. READ the outline to understand:
#    - Which phases are active
#    - User's intentions for each phase
#    - Current status of each phase
#    - What work has been completed
#    - What work is next
# 3. SKIP analysis of inactive phases (active: false)
# 4. REPORT status based on outline (much faster than folder scanning)
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When Starting Scenario Work (Freya WDS Designer Agent):
#
# Add new scenario to the outline:
#
# yaml
# scenarios:
#   - id: "01-customer-onboarding"
#     name: "Customer Onboarding"
#     status: "in_progress"
#     pages_planned: 9
#     pages_specified: 0
#     pages_implemented: 0
#     started_date: "2024-12-10"
#     completed_date: null
#     intent: "Onboard new users from landing page to active family"
#     artifacts: []
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When Completing Scenario Work (Freya WDS Designer Agent):
#
# Update scenario status:
#
# yaml
#   - id: "01-customer-onboarding"
#     name: "Customer Onboarding"
#     status: "complete"
#     pages_planned: 9
#     pages_specified: 9
#     pages_implemented: 5
#     started_date: "2024-12-01"
#     completed_date: "2024-12-08"
#     intent: "Onboard new users from landing page to active family"
#     artifacts:
#       - "docs/4-ux-design/01-customer-onboarding/00-scenario-overview.md"
#       - "docs/4-ux-design/01-customer-onboarding/1.1-start-page.md"
#       - "docs/4-ux-design/01-customer-onboarding/sketches/*.excalidraw"
#
# Update phase-level counters:
# yaml
# scenarios_complete: 1  # Increment
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When Starting/Completing Phase Work (ALL Agents):
#
# Starting:
# yaml
# status: "in_progress"
# started_date: "2024-12-10"
#
# Completing:
# yaml
# status: "complete"
# completed_date: "2024-12-10"
# completed_by: "Freya WDS Designer Agent"
# artifacts:
#   - "docs/4-ux-design/01-onboarding/*.md"
#
# Add update history entry:
# yaml
# update_history:
#   - date: "2024-12-10"
#     agent: "freya-designer"
#     action: "completed"
#     phase: "phase_4_ux_design"
#     changes: "Completed Scenario 01: 9 pages specified with prototypes"
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Benefits:
#
# ✅ User-driven planning - captures intentions upfront during project initiation
# ✅ 5x faster agent activation - no folder scanning needed
# ✅ Scenario-level tracking - granular progress visibility within UX Design phase
# ✅ Always up to date - agents update as they work
# ✅ Clear intent - explains WHY phases are skipped AND user's goals for each phase
# ✅ Project memory - tracks who did what and when
# ✅ Better recommendations - agents know exactly what's next
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# File Location:
#
# - Preferred: docs/.wds-project-outline.yaml
# - Fallback: .wds-project-outline.yaml (project root)
# - Created by: Saga WDS Analyst Agent during Project Brief phase
# - Updated by: ALL WDS agents as work progresses
