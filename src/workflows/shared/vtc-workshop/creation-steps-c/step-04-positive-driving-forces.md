# Step 4: Identify Positive Driving Forces

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Purpose:** Discover what the user WANTS to achieve (aspirations, wishes)

---

## What You'll Do

Identify 2-3 positive driving forces - what makes this user want to engage with the solution.

---

## Questions to Ask User

> "What does [user name] WANT to achieve? What would make them feel successful?"

**Probing questions:**
- "What would 'winning' look like for them?"
- "What outcome would they be proud of?"
- "What would they brag about to colleagues/friends?"
- "What capability would transform their work/life?"

---

## Guidelines

**Think aspirations, not just functional needs:**
- Not: "Upload files"
- Yes: "Wish to feel organized and in control"

**What would they feel:**
- Proud of?
- Excited about?
- Validated by?
- Transformed by?

**Aim for 2-3 strong wishes:**
- Quality over quantity
- Specific enough to inform design
- Emotionally resonant

---

## Examples

**Hairdresser (Harriet):**
- "Wish to be the local beauty authority"
- "Wish to attract premium clients"
- "Wish to be seen as cutting-edge"

**Developer (reviewing code):**
- "Wish to be helpful to teammates"
- "Wish to catch critical bugs"
- "Wish to be recognized for thorough reviews"

**Small business owner:**
- "Wish to understand finances clearly"
- "Wish to make confident decisions"
- "Wish to prove business is growing"

---

## Capture Format

```yaml
driving_forces:
  positive:
    - "Wish to [aspiration]"
    - "Wish to [aspiration]"
    - "Wish to [aspiration]"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
driving_forces:
  positive:
    - "Wish to be local beauty authority"
    - "Wish to attract premium clients"
    - "Wish to be seen as cutting-edge"
```

## Validation Checklist

Before proceeding, confirm:

- [ ] Forces feel true for this user?
- [ ] Specific enough to inform design?
- [ ] Emotionally resonant (not just functional)?
- [ ] 2-3 forces captured (not too many)?
- [ ] User agrees these motivate their target?

---

## Common Issues

**Issue:** Forces too generic ("want to save time")

**Solution:**
> "Save time doing WHAT specifically? WHY does saving that time matter to them? What would they do with that time?"

**Issue:** Too many wishes listed (7+)

**Solution:**
> "Which 2-3 matter MOST? If we could only address three, which would transform their experience?"

**Issue:** Only functional needs ("need to upload files")

**Solution:**
> "Why do they need that? What would having that enable them to achieve? What would they feel?"

## Design Hint

These positive forces should inform:
- Success messaging
- Aspirational content
- Celebration moments
- Value proposition

## Next Step
