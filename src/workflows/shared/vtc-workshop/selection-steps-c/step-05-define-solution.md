# Step 5: Define Solution

**Duration:** 2 minutes

**Purpose:** Define what we're building (NOT in Trigger Map - solutions stay out of map)

---

## Ask User

> "What solution are you building to serve this VTC?"

**Reminder:** This is the bridge between business goal and user.

---

## Guidelines

Same as Creation Workshop - specific about WHAT this is:

**Good examples:**
- "Landing page with newsletter signup"
- "Onboarding flow for new users"
- "User profile settings page"

---

## Capture Format

```yaml
solution: "[Specific solution being built]"
```

---

## Test Connection

Business Goal (from map) → Solution (new) → User (from map) → Forces (from map)

Does this chain make sense?

---

## Validation

- [ ] Solution is specific?
- [ ] Solution serves selected business goal?
- [ ] Solution connects to selected user and forces?

---

## Next Step
