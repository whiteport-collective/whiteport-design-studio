# Step 3: Select User

**Duration:** 2 minutes

**Purpose:** Choose which user/target group from Trigger Map this VTC focuses on

---

## Present Available Users

Show users connected to selected business goal:

> "For [selected goal], your Trigger Map has these target groups:
> 
> 1. [User 1 - brief description]
>    Priority: [score]
>    Key driving forces: [top 2-3]
> 
> 2. [User 2 - brief description]
>    Priority: [score]
>    Key driving forces: [top 2-3]
> 
> Which user is primary for this [solution/scenario]?"

---

## User Selects

**One primary user** for this VTC

**If multiple users important:**
> "We can create additional VTCs for other users. For THIS VTC, let's focus on one."

---

## If User Not in Map

**User:** "None of these users match. My scenario is for [different user type]."

**Options:**

**A) Add to Trigger Map now:**
1. Pause VTC workshop
2. Add new user/target group to Trigger Map
3. Map their driving forces
4. Resume with new user available

**B) Switch to Creation Workshop:**
1. If this is a one-off scenario
2. Create VTC from scratch for this user
3. Consider adding to Trigger Map later

**C) Adapt existing user:**
1. Pick closest match
2. Note variations in VTC
3. Consider if map needs new segment

**Recommendation:** If this represents a significant new user segment, add to Trigger Map. Future scenarios will benefit.

  priority: "[Priority score from map]"
```
