# Value Trigger Chain (VTC) Workshop

**Goal:** Create a Value Trigger Chain to connect business goals, user needs, and driving forces

**Your Role:** Strategic facilitator helping create or select VTC based on available context (Trigger Map or from scratch)

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** with **routing logic**:

### Core Principles

- **Context-Based Routing**: Selection (if Trigger Map exists) or Creation (from scratch)
- **Strategic Foundation**: VTC connects business goals → solution → user → driving forces → awareness
- **Flexibility**: Can be created early (Product Pitch) or scenario-specific
- **YAML Output**: Structured format for reuse across project

### Critical Rules

- 🎯 **ALWAYS** determine context first (Trigger Map exists?)
- 🔀 **ALWAYS** route to appropriate workshop based on context
- 📊 **ALWAYS** output YAML format
- 🎯 **ALWAYS** capture 2-5 driving forces (positive and negative)
- 📍 **ALWAYS** define customer awareness journey (start → end)

---

## WHEN TO USE

Use this workflow when:
- ✅ Creating Product Pitch (need primary VTC)
- ✅ Defining new scenario (need scenario-specific VTC)
- ✅ Need strategic clarity before design
- ✅ Want to connect business goals to user needs

Skip this workflow when:
- ❌ VTC already exists for this context
- ❌ No strategic planning needed (pure visual design)
- ❌ Working from existing detailed requirements

---

## ROUTING DECISION

**First Question:** "Do you have a completed Trigger Map?"

### Route A: VTC Selection Workshop
**IF YES** - Trigger Map exists

**Use when:**
- Trigger Map is completed
- Want to extract VTC from existing strategic work
- Need consistency with Trigger Map
- Multiple scenarios need VTCs

**Benefits:**
- Leverage existing research
- Maintain consistency
- Faster (select vs. imagine)

**Steps folder:** `selection-steps-c/`

---

### Route B: VTC Creation Workshop
**IF NO** - No Trigger Map yet

**Use when:**
- No Trigger Map available
- Early stage (Product Pitch)
- Quick project needing lightweight approach
- Standalone scenario/prototype

**Benefits:**
- Get started immediately
- No Trigger Map overhead
- Sufficient for simple projects

**Steps folder:** `creation-steps-c/`

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Router Entry Point

Start here: `vtc-workshop-router.md`

This determines which workshop to run based on available context.

### Guide References

Selection workshop: `vtc-selection-workshop.md`
Creation workshop: `vtc-creation-workshop.md`
Template: `vtc-template.yaml`
Methodology: `vtc-workshop-guide.md`

### First Step Execution

**After routing decision:**

**IF Selection Workshop:**
Load, read and execute `selection-steps-c/step-01-load-trigger-map.md`

**IF Creation Workshop:**
Load, read and execute `creation-steps-c/step-01-define-business-goal.md`

---

## OUTPUT

**Completed VTC (YAML format):**

```yaml
businessGoal: [What business wants to achieve]
solution: [How we help user achieve their goal]
user: [Who we're helping]
drivingForces:
  positive:
    - [What they want/hope for]
    - [Another positive driver]
  negative:
    - [What they fear/avoid]
    - [Another negative driver]
customerAwareness:
  start: [Where they are now]
  end: [Where they need to be]
```

**Destination:**
- Product Pitch: `docs/A-Product-Brief/vtc-primary.yaml`
- Scenario: `docs/D-UX-Design/[scenario-name]/vtc.yaml`

---

## EXAMPLE USE CASES

### Use Case 1: Product Pitch (No Trigger Map)
→ Route to Creation Workshop
→ Create primary VTC from scratch
→ Save to `docs/A-Product-Brief/vtc-primary.yaml`

### Use Case 2: Scenario Definition (Trigger Map Exists)
→ Route to Selection Workshop
→ Select business goal + user from Trigger Map
→ Customize driving forces for scenario
→ Save to `docs/D-UX-Design/[scenario]/vtc.yaml`

### Use Case 3: Multiple Scenarios
→ Route to Selection Workshop for each
→ Create variant VTCs from same Trigger Map
→ Maintain consistency across scenarios
