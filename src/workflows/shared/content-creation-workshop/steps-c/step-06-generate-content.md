# Step 6: Generate & Review Content

**Create content options and select the final version**

---

## Purpose

This is where the strategic work from Steps 1-5 becomes actual content. The agent generates 2-3 variations based on all the strategic context, and you select or combine them into the final version.

---

## Duration

⏱️ **5-10 minutes**

---

## The Single Task

**Generate strategically grounded content variations → User selects/combines → Finalize**

---

## Context from Previous Steps

**Step 1 - VTC Context:**
- Business goal, solution, user, driving forces, customer awareness

**Step 2 - Awareness Strategy:**
- Language guidelines, information priorities, emotional journey

**Step 3 - Action Filter:**
- Required action, essential information, barriers to address

**Step 4 - Empowerment Frame:**
- Transformation (current → badass), "aha moment," capability framing

**Step 5 - Structural Order:**
- WHY-HOW-WHAT sequence, content mapped to sections

## Agent Instructions

### Generation Process

**Reference:** See [substeps/06-generation-instructions.md](substeps/06-generation-instructions.md) for detailed instructions on:
1. Synthesizing all context
2. Generating 2-3 variations (wish-focused, fear-focused, balanced)
3. Presentation format
4. Explaining strategic choices

**Key Point:** Generate variations that differ in which driving forces they emphasize, then let user select or combine.

---

## Questions for the User

### 1. Initial Reaction

**"Which variation resonates most with you?"**

- Variation A (wish-focused)?
- Variation B (fear-focused)?
- Variation C (balanced/awareness-shifted)?
- Combination of elements?

### 2. Alignment Check

**"Does this feel aligned with the strategic context?"**

- Does it serve the VTC's business goal?
- Does it speak to the user's driving forces?
- Does it meet them at their awareness level?
- Does it enable the required action?
- Does it frame around capability?
- Does it follow WHY → HOW → WHAT?

### 3. Refinement

**"What would you adjust or combine?"**

- Headline from A, but body from B?
- Stronger emphasis on X?
- Softer tone on Y?
- Add/remove specific element?

### 4. Missing Anything?

**"Is anything missing that we identified in previous steps?"**

Check against:
- Essential information (Step 3)
- Barriers to address (Step 3)
- "Aha moment" (Step 4)
- Cognitive load reductions (Step 4)

### 5. Awareness Journey Validation

**"Does this move the user from START → END awareness?"**

- At START, can they understand the opening?
- By END, have they reached the target awareness level?
- Is the journey smooth or jarring?

## Agent Actions

1. **Generate 2-3 variations** with clear rationale (see generation instructions)
2. **Present them** using the structured format
3. **Explain strategic choices** for each
4. **Guide refinement** based on user feedback
5. **Finalize content** incorporating adjustments
6. **Document** final version with strategic traceability

## Complete Workshop Output

**Save everything together:**

Use the template: `content-output.template.md`

This creates a complete record:
1. VTC Context (Step 1)
2. Awareness Strategy (Step 2)
3. Action Filter (Step 3)
4. Empowerment Frame (Step 4)
5. Structural Order (Step 5)
6. Content Generation (Step 6)

**Result:** Strategically grounded content with full traceability.

---

## Example

**See:** [substeps/06-example-hairdresser-newsletter.md](substeps/06-example-hairdresser-newsletter.md)

This shows a complete example of:
- Three variations (wish-focused, fear-focused, balanced)
- User selection and combination
- Final content with strategic traceability

---

## Workshop Complete! 🎉

**You now have:**
- Strategically grounded content
- Full traceability to business goals and user psychology
- Content that serves a clear action
- Empowering, capability-focused framing
- Persuasive WHY → HOW → WHAT structure

**Next Steps:**
- Implement content in design/development
- Test with real users
- Iterate based on performance
- Apply this workshop to next content section

---

## Notes

- Variations are not drafts—they're strategic alternatives
- User may prefer different elements from different variations—that's expected
- If no variation feels right, loop back to check strategic context (Steps 1-5)
- The strategic traceability document is crucial—don't skip it
- This is content creation as strategic craft, not guesswork

---

**⚠️ ALPHA:** Was this final step satisfying? Did variations help or confuse? How was the refinement process? Feedback critical for improvement.
