# Step 2: Apply Customer Awareness Strategy

**Determine the right language, information, and proof for the user's awareness level**

---

## Purpose

The Customer Awareness Cycle determines WHAT you can say and HOW you say it. A user who is "Problem Aware" needs completely different language than one who is "Product Aware." This step translates the VTC's awareness positioning into concrete content strategy.

---

## Duration

⏱️ **5-7 minutes**

---

## What You're Doing

Using the Customer Awareness Cycle model to determine:
- What language the user can understand
- What information they need at this stage
- What proof/credibility is required
- What emotional journey we're facilitating

---

## Context from Previous Step

**VTC loaded in Step 1:**
- Customer Awareness: **[START] → [END]**

---

## The Customer Awareness Cycle (Quick Reference)

**5 Levels (Eugene Schwartz):**

1. **Unaware** - Don't know they have a problem
2. **Problem Aware** - Know the problem, don't know solutions exist
3. **Solution Aware** - Know solutions exist, exploring options
4. **Product Aware** - Know your product, evaluating it
5. **Most Aware** - Ready to buy/use, need final push

---

## Questions for the User

### 1. Validate Starting Awareness Level

**"Let's confirm where the user is when they encounter this content:"**

Present the START level from VTC and describe what it means:

**Example:** *"The VTC says users are 'Problem Aware' - meaning they know they're struggling with [problem], but might not know that solutions like [your solution type] exist. Does this match your understanding of where users are when they encounter this [page/section]?"*

- If YES → Continue
- If NO → Discuss and adjust VTC

### 2. Clarify Target Awareness Level

**"And where do we want them after reading this content?"**

Present the END level from VTC and describe the shift:

**Example:** *"We want to move them to 'Solution Aware' - meaning after this section, they should understand that [solution category] exists and can solve their [problem]. Is that the right goal for this content?"*

- If YES → Continue
- If NO → Discuss and adjust VTC

### 3. Awareness-Appropriate Language

**"What can they understand at their STARTING level?"**

Explore together:

- **If Problem Aware:** Can we use your product name? Or should we speak in problem language first?
- **If Solution Aware:** Do they understand the solution category terminology? Or do we need to explain it?
- **If Product Aware:** What specific features matter to them? What comparisons are they making?

**"What words will resonate vs. confuse?"**

### 4. Information Priorities

**"What do they NEED to know at this stage?"**

Different awareness levels need different information:

- **Problem Aware needs:** Problem validation, emotional recognition, hint that solutions exist
- **Solution Aware needs:** How this type of solution works, why it's effective, what makes solutions good/bad
- **Product Aware needs:** Specific features, proof it works, why choose you vs. competitors

**"What's essential vs. overwhelming at their starting point?"**

### 5. Credibility Requirements

**"What proof do they need to believe us?"**

Different awareness levels trust different things:

- **Problem Aware:** Personal stories, emotional validation ("You're not alone")
- **Solution Aware:** Expert credentials, how it works explanations, logic
- **Product Aware:** Social proof, testimonials, data, comparisons

**"What will make this credible to them?"**

### 6. Emotional Journey

**"What emotional shift happens from START → END?"**

Explore the transformation:

- **Starting emotion:** How do they FEEL at START level? (frustrated, confused, overwhelmed, cautious?)
- **Ending emotion:** How should they FEEL at END level? (hopeful, informed, confident, excited?)

**"What's the emotional bridge we're building?"**

## Agent Actions

1. **Present awareness level analysis** based on VTC
2. **Explore each question** with the user
3. **Document the answers** in structured format
4. **Validate strategy** before moving forward

---

## Validation

Before proceeding to Step 3:

- [ ] Start awareness level is confirmed and understood
- [ ] End awareness level is confirmed and understood
- [ ] Appropriate language identified (what words to use/avoid)
- [ ] Information priorities clear (what to include/exclude)
- [ ] Credibility requirements identified (what proof is needed)
- [ ] Emotional journey mapped (start feeling → end feeling)

## Next Step

Once awareness strategy is defined:

**→ Proceed to [Step 3: Define Required Action](step-03-action-filter.md)**

---

## Example

**VTC Context:** Hairdresser newsletter signup
- Start: Problem Aware ("I feel behind on trends")
- End: Product Aware ("This newsletter will keep me current")

**Awareness Strategy:**

```yaml
awareness_strategy:
  start_level: "Problem Aware"
  start_characteristics:
    - "Knows she's missing trends"
    - "Doesn't know trend newsletters exist"
    - "Feels frustrated and behind"
  
  end_level: "Product Aware"
  end_characteristics:
    - "Knows trend newsletters exist"
    - "Understands how TrendWeek works"
    - "Feels hopeful about staying current"
  
  language_guidelines:
    use: ["missing trends", "falling behind", "your clients ask", "stay current"]
    avoid: ["TrendWeek" in headline, technical jargon, assuming knowledge]
    tone: "Empathetic and empowering"
  
  information_priorities:
    essential: 
      - "Validate the problem (you're not alone)"
      - "Introduce solution category (trend newsletters)"
      - "Show how it works (weekly digest)"
    helpful:
      - "Social proof (2,000 stylists)"
      - "Time commitment (60 seconds per trend)"
    avoid:
      - "Company history"
      - "Technical newsletter infrastructure"
  
  credibility_required:
    type: "Social proof + Practical value"
    examples: 
      - "Testimonial: 'My clients always ask how I stay so current'"
      - "Specific: 'Top 5 trends every Monday'"
  
  emotional_journey:
    starting_emotion: "Frustrated and behind"
    bridge: "Recognition → Hope → Confidence"
    ending_emotion: "Empowered and excited to try"
```
