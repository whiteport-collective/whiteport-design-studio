# Step 4: Frame User Empowerment

**Apply Kathy Sierra's Badass Users principles to tone and framing**

---

## Purpose

Kathy Sierra's core insight: **Don't make a better product. Make a better USER.**

This step frames content to make users feel capable, show their transformation, create "aha moments," and reduce cognitive load. Content isn't about YOU—it's about them becoming badass.

---

## Duration

⏱️ **5-7 minutes**

---

## The Single Task

**Apply Badass Users framework to frame content around user capability and transformation**

---

## Context from Previous Steps

**VTC:** User, driving forces, awareness positioning  
**Awareness Strategy:** Emotional journey (start emotion → end emotion)  
**Action Filter:** Required action and essential information

---

## Badass Users Framework

**Quick Reference:** See [substeps/04-badass-users-principles.md](substeps/04-badass-users-principles.md) for detailed framework.

**Core:** "You'll be able to..." not "Our product has..."

**Five Principles:**
1. Make Them Better (not product better)
2. Show The Transformation (current → badass)
3. Create "Aha Moments" (perspective shifts)
4. Reduce Cognitive Load (simplify ruthlessly)
5. Focus on Skills (not tools)

---

## Questions for the User

### 1. Define Current vs. Badass State

**"What's the user's CURRENT state?"**

Be specific and empathetic:
- What are they struggling with?
- How do they feel? (frustrated, uncertain, overwhelmed, behind?)
- What can't they do yet?

**"What's their BADASS state after success?"**

Paint the picture:
- What will they be able to do?
- How will they feel? (confident, capable, ahead?)
- What transformation happened?

---

### 2. Identify the "Aha Moment"

**"What insight or realization will make them say 'Oh! I get it!'?"**

The "aha moment" isn't just understanding—it's a perspective shift:

**Examples:**
- "Oh! I don't need to follow 100 accounts—I just need THIS digest!"
- "Oh! This is about my CLIENT'S reactions, not just knowing trends!"
- "Oh! 60 seconds is all I need—I thought it would take hours!"

**"What's the key insight that unlocks confidence?"**

---

### 3. Frame Around Capability

**"How do we frame this content to highlight THEIR capability, not our features?"**

Transform feature-focused language:

**Before (feature-focus):**
- "Our AI analyzes 10,000 beauty sources"
- "We send weekly emails with 5 trends"

**After (capability-focus):**
- "You'll spot trends before your competitors"
- "You'll always have something new to talk about with clients"

**"How can we reframe essential information to focus on what THEY can do?"**

---

### 4. Show the Transformation Path

**"How do we make the transformation visible and achievable?"**

Users need to see:
- Where they are (current state)
- Where they're going (badass state)
- That the path is real and manageable

**"What makes the transformation feel real and achievable, not aspirational?"**

Examples:
- Specific numbers: "60 seconds per trend" (concrete)
- Social proof: "2,000 stylists already there" (others did it)
- Quick win: "Try it on your next client" (immediate)

---

### 5. Reduce Cognitive Load

**"Where might this content overwhelm or confuse?"**

Look for cognitive load issues:
- Too many choices? → Reduce options or guide selection
- Too much jargon? → Use plain language
- Too many steps? → Break down or simplify
- Unclear what to do? → Make next step obvious

**"What can we simplify or cut to reduce mental effort?"**

---

### 6. Focus on Skills Over Tools

**"What skill or capability are we helping them develop?"**

Not:
- "Using our platform"
- "Receiving emails"

But:
- "Staying current effortlessly"
- "Becoming the local authority"

**"Can we frame this around the skill they gain, not the tool they use?"**

---

## Agent Actions

1. **Guide user to articulate** current vs. badass transformation
2. **Identify the "aha moment"** that shifts perspective
3. **Reframe essential information** from Step 3 using capability language
4. **Map the transformation path** to make it visible
5. **Identify and address** cognitive load issues
6. **Document the empowerment framing**

---

## Validation

Before proceeding to Step 5:

- [ ] Current state clearly defined (where user is now)
- [ ] Badass state clearly defined (where they're going)
- [ ] "Aha moment" identified (key insight that unlocks confidence)
- [ ] Content framed around user capability (not features)
- [ ] Transformation path visible and achievable
- [ ] Cognitive load issues identified and addressed
- [ ] Focus on skills gained, not tools used

---

## Output

**Empowerment Frame Document:**

```yaml
empowerment_frame:
  transformation:
    current_state:
      description: "[Where user is now]"
      feelings: ["frustrated", "uncertain", "behind"]
      capabilities: "[What they can't do yet]"
    
    badass_state:
      description: "[Where they're going]"
      feelings: ["confident", "capable", "ahead"]
      capabilities: "[What they'll be able to do]"
    
    visibility: "[How we make the transformation visible and achievable]"
  
  aha_moment:
    insight: "[Key realization that shifts perspective]"
    why_powerful: "[Why this unlocks confidence]"
  
  capability_framing:
    - feature: "[Product feature]"
      reframed: "[What USER can do because of it]"
    - feature: "[Product feature]"
      reframed: "[What USER can do because of it]"
  
  cognitive_load:
    potential_issues:
      - issue: "[Where content might overwhelm]"
        solution: "[How we reduce load]"
    
    simplifications:
      - "[What we simplified or cut]"
  
  skill_focus:
    primary_skill: "[Main capability user develops]"
    supporting_skills: ["[Related capabilities]"]
    tools_secondary: "[Tools are means to skill, not the focus]"
```

## Next Step

Once empowerment framing is defined:

**→ Proceed to [Step 5: Determine Structural Order](step-05-structural-order.md)**

## Example

**See:** [substeps/04-example-empowerment-frame.md](substeps/04-example-empowerment-frame.md)

This shows complete Badass Users framework application for hairdresser newsletter, demonstrating transformation framing, aha moment, capability reframing, cognitive load reduction, and skill focus

---

## Notes

- This is where content shifts from "us-focused" to "you-focused"
- The transformation must feel REAL, not aspirational marketing fluff
- "Aha moments" are specific insights, not vague "understanding"
- Cognitive load reduction often means cutting 30-40% of planned content
- If you can't define a clear skill focus, content might be too product-centric

**⚠️ ALPHA:** Did this framing process help shift perspective? Or feel too abstract? Feedback welcome.
