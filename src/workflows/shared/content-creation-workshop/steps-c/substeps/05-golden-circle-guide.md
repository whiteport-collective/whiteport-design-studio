# Golden Circle Framework Guide

**Simon Sinek's WHY → HOW → WHAT model for persuasive content sequencing**

## The Golden Circle Model

```
    WHY (Core)
     ↓
    HOW (Process)
     ↓
    WHAT (Proof)
```

---

## The Three Levels

### WHY - The Purpose, Cause, Belief

**Purpose:** Connect emotionally, establish motivation

**Questions:**
- Why does this matter?
- Why should the user care?
- What's the emotional truth?

**Good WHY Examples:**
- "Are your clients asking about trends you haven't heard of?" (emotional truth)
- "You deserve to feel ahead, not behind" (aspiration)
- "Every stylist feels this—you're not alone" (validation)

**Bad WHY Examples:**
- "Our company was founded in 2018" (not emotional)
- "TrendWeek is a beauty newsletter" (WHAT, not WHY)
- "Sign up now" (jumping to action without motivation)

**Connects to:**
- User's driving forces (from VTC)
- Current emotional state (from Empowerment Frame)
- The problem or aspiration that matters

---

### HOW - The Process, Approach, Differentiator

**Purpose:** Bridge emotion to specifics, show the method

**Questions:**
- How does this work?
- How do you do it differently?
- What's the method?

**Example HOW Content:**
- "Here's how stylists stay ahead: Weekly trend alerts delivered Monday morning"
- "60-second explainers—understand trends fast enough to use them same day"
- "Client conversation starters included—no guesswork"

**Connects to:**
- Essential information (Action Filter)
- Capability framing (Empowerment Frame)
- The transformation path

---

### WHAT - The Tangible, Proof, Specifics

**Purpose:** Provide concrete details and enable action

**Questions:**
- What exactly do you do/offer?
- What are the features?
- What's the concrete evidence?

**Example WHAT Content:**
- "Join TrendWeek—Free for Stylists"
- "2,000 stylists already ahead"
- "Start Staying Ahead" (CTA button)
- "Free. Cancel anytime."

**Includes:**
- Specific features or offers
- Tangible evidence
- Social proof
- The ask/action

---

## Key Insights

**Start with WHY:**
- People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it
- Emotion drives decisions, logic justifies them
- WHY creates connection before presenting solution

**Bridge with HOW:**
- HOW explains the approach that delivers on the WHY
- Shows your unique method or differentiator
- Builds confidence in the transformation

**Prove with WHAT:**
- WHAT provides concrete specifics after buy-in
- Only effective after WHY and HOW establish context
- Enables action with confidence

---

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Starting with WHAT**
- ❌ "TrendWeek is a weekly newsletter for hairdressers..."
- ✅ "Are your clients asking about trends you haven't heard of?"

**Mistake #2: Missing WHY**
- Content feels cold and transactional
- No emotional connection
- Features without context

**Mistake #3: WHAT before WHY**
- Content feels salesy and pushy
- User isn't ready to hear specifics
- Premature call to action

## Sequencing Within Sections

The Golden Circle is fractal—apply it at page level AND within each section:

**WHY Section Micro-sequence:**
1. Problem recognition (emotional hook)
2. Validation (you're not alone)
3. Aspiration (you can feel different)

**HOW Section Micro-sequence:**
1. Introduce solution approach
2. Explain key differentiator
3. Show transformation path

**WHAT Section Micro-sequence:**
1. Name the product/offer
2. Social proof
3. Clear CTA
4. Risk removal

---

## Application Notes

- The "aha moment" from Step 4 often lives in the HOW section (the insight that bridges emotion to action)
- If WHAT comes before WHY, content feels salesy and pushy
- If WHY is missing, content feels cold and transactional
- This structure works for pages, sections, paragraphs, even sentences
- The Golden Circle creates natural persuasive flow: emotion → method → specifics
