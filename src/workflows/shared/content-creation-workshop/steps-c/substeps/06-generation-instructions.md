# Content Generation Instructions

**How to generate strategically grounded content variations**

---

## 1. Synthesize All Context

Before generating, review and confirm you understand:
- [ ] WHO the user is and what drives them (VTC)
- [ ] WHERE they are in awareness (START → END)
- [ ] WHAT action this content must enable (Action Filter)
- [ ] HOW to make them feel capable (Empowerment Frame)
- [ ] WHAT order creates persuasive flow (Golden Circle)

---

## 2. Generate Multiple Variations

Create **2-3 content variations** that differ in:

**Variation A: Wish-Focused**
- Emphasizes positive driving forces
- Aspirational tone
- "Become the authority," "Stay ahead," "Impress your clients"

**Variation B: Fear-Focused**
- Addresses negative driving forces
- Problem-recognition tone
- "Stop feeling behind," "Never miss a trend," "No more embarrassment"

**Variation C: Balanced OR Awareness-Shifted** (choose one):
- **Balanced:** Combines wish + fear naturally
- **Awareness-Shifted:** Uses different starting awareness level (if user was uncertain)

**For each variation, include:**
- Complete content (headlines, body, CTA)
- Rationale explaining the approach
- Why this might resonate

---

## 3. Presentation Format

Use this format:

```markdown
---

## Variation A: [Name - e.g., "Wish-Focused"]

### Rationale
[Why this approach, what driving force it emphasizes, when this works best]

### Content

**WHY Section:**
[Content for WHY]

**HOW Section:**
[Content for HOW]

**WHAT Section:**
[Content for WHAT]

### Why This Might Resonate
[Specific user insight or context that makes this effective]

---

## Variation B: [Name]
[Same structure]

---

## Variation C: [Name]
[Same structure]

---
```

---

## 4. Explain Strategic Choices

For each variation, show how you applied the strategic context:
- "This opens with [X] because the user is Problem Aware—they need problem validation first"
- "This uses 'you'll be able to' framing because of Badass Users principle"
- "This puts social proof before CTA because Action Filter identified trust as a barrier"

**Make the strategy visible.**
