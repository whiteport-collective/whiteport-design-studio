# Content Purpose Examples

**Three examples demonstrating how to define clear, testable content purpose**

---

## Example 1: Landing Page Hero

```yaml
content_purpose:
  content_type: "Landing page hero section"

  purpose_statement: "Hook Problem Aware hairdressers by validating their frustration and promising transformation"

  audience:
    who: "Harriet (hairdresser, ambitious, small-town)"
    state: "Problem Aware - feels behind when clients ask about trends"
    context: "Landing on site from Google search or Instagram ad"

  success_criteria:
    - "User immediately recognizes themselves in the problem"
    - "User feels validated, not alone"
    - "User wants to continue reading (doesn't bounce)"

  model_priorities:
    primary: ["Customer Awareness ⭐⭐⭐", "Golden Circle ⭐⭐⭐"]
    secondary: ["Badass Users ⭐⭐", "VTC ⭐⭐"]
    tertiary: ["Action Mapping ⭐"]

  review_question: "Does a Problem Aware hairdresser feel seen and want to learn more?"
```

**Analysis:**
- **Specific audience state:** Problem Aware (not just "hairdressers")
- **Measurable outcome:** "Recognizes themselves" and "doesn't bounce"
- **Model priority:** Customer Awareness and Golden Circle emphasized for landing page hook
- **Testable:** Can observe if users recognize themselves and continue reading

## Example 2: Error Message

```yaml
content_purpose:
  content_type: "Form validation error message"

  purpose_statement: "Help user fix invalid email while maintaining confidence and reducing frustration"

  audience:
    who: "New user attempting signup"
    state: "Frustrated - made a typo, wants to fix it quickly"
    context: "Just clicked submit and saw error"

  success_criteria:
    - "User understands what's wrong"
    - "User knows exactly how to fix it"
    - "User doesn't feel stupid or blamed"
    - "User successfully resubmits"

  model_priorities:
    primary: ["Badass Users ⭐⭐⭐", "Action Mapping ⭐⭐⭐"]
    secondary: ["Customer Awareness ⭐"]
    tertiary: ["Golden Circle ⭐", "VTC ⭐"]

  review_question: "Can user fix error quickly without feeling frustrated?"
```

**Analysis:**
- **Emotional state:** Frustrated (critical for error messages)
- **Dual focus:** Fix problem AND maintain confidence
- **Model priority:** Badass Users and Action Mapping for functional content
- **Testable:** Can measure successful resubmission and user sentiment

## Example 3: Product Comparison Feature

```yaml
content_purpose:
  content_type: "Shelf life comparison row in feature table"

  purpose_statement: "Convince value-conscious users that 3x longer shelf life saves them money and hassle"

  audience:
    who: "Product Aware users comparing us to competitors"
    state: "Evaluating features, looking for differentiators"
    context: "In active comparison mode, possibly has competitor tab open"

  success_criteria:
    - "User understands the 3x advantage"
    - "User connects longer shelf life to personal benefit (saves money/waste)"
    - "User sees this as competitive advantage worth paying for"

  model_priorities:
    primary: ["VTC ⭐⭐⭐", "Badass Users ⭐⭐"]
    secondary: ["Action Mapping ⭐⭐", "Customer Awareness ⭐"]
    tertiary: ["Golden Circle ⭐"]

  review_question: "Does user see 3x shelf life as a compelling reason to choose us?"
```

**Analysis:**
- **Comparison context:** User actively evaluating competitors
- **Value connection:** Not just "3x longer" but "saves money/hassle"
- **Model priority:** VTC emphasized for understanding driving forces
- **Testable:** Can assess if users understand and value the advantage
