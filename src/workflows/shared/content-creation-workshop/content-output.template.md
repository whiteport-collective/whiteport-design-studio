## Strategic Foundation

### Step 1: VTC Context

```yaml
vtc_reference:
  business_goal: "{goal text}"
  solution: "{solution name/description}"
  user:
    name: "{persona name}"
    description: "{brief persona description}"
  driving_forces:
    positive: "{wish/aspiration}"
    negative: "{fear/frustration}"
  customer_awareness:
    start: "{awareness level where user begins}"
    end: "{awareness level we want them to reach}"
```

---

## Content Strategy

### Step 2: Customer Awareness Strategy

```yaml
awareness_strategy:
  start_level: "{awareness level}"
  start_characteristics:
    - "{what they know}"
    - "{what they don't know}"
    - "{how they feel}"
  
  end_level: "{awareness level}"
  end_characteristics:
    - "{what they'll know}"
    - "{what they'll understand}"
    - "{how they'll feel}"
  
  language_guidelines:
    use: ["{appropriate terms}"]
    avoid: ["{confusing jargon}"]
    tone: "{conversational, authoritative, empathetic, etc.}"
  
  information_priorities:
    essential: ["{must include}"]
    helpful: ["{nice to include if space}"]
    avoid: ["{too advanced, confusing, or premature}"]
  
  credibility_required:
    type: "{personal story, expert credentials, data, social proof}"
    examples: ["{specific proof elements}"]
  
  emotional_journey:
    starting_emotion: "{frustrated, confused, etc.}"
    bridge: "{how we facilitate the shift}"
    ending_emotion: "{hopeful, confident, etc.}"
```

## Content Filtering

### Step 3: Action Filter

```yaml
action_filter:
  required_action:
    description: "{Specific action user must be able to take}"
    success_criteria: "{How we know they can do it}"
  
  business_impact:
    connection: "{How this action drives the VTC business goal}"
    logic: "{Action → Outcome → Goal}"
  
  user_motivation:
    positive_driver: "{How action satisfies their wish}"
    negative_driver: "{How action addresses their fear}"
  
  essential_information:
    - "{Information element 1 - WHY needed for action}"
    - "{Information element 2 - WHY needed for action}"
    - "{Information element 3 - WHY needed for action}"
  
  cut_list:
    - "{Nice-to-know info that doesn't enable action}"
    - "{Impressive but irrelevant content}"
  
  action_barriers:
    - barrier: "{e.g., confusion about next steps}"
      solution: "{Content that removes this barrier}"
    - barrier: "{e.g., fear of commitment}"
      solution: "{Content that addresses this fear}"
```

---

## Content Framing

### Step 4: Empowerment Frame

```yaml
empowerment_frame:
  transformation:
    current_state:
      description: "{Where user is now}"
      feelings: ["{frustrated}", "{uncertain}", "{behind}"]
      capabilities: "{What they can't do yet}"
    
    badass_state:
      description: "{Where they're going}"
      feelings: ["{confident}", "{capable}", "{ahead}"]
      capabilities: "{What they'll be able to do}"
    
    visibility: "{How we make the transformation visible and achievable}"
  
  aha_moment:
    insight: "{Key realization that shifts perspective}"
    why_powerful: "{Why this unlocks confidence}"
  
  capability_framing:
    - feature: "{Product feature}"
      reframed: "{What USER can do because of it}"
    - feature: "{Product feature}"
      reframed: "{What USER can do because of it}"
  
  cognitive_load:
    potential_issues:
      - issue: "{Where content might overwhelm}"
        solution: "{How we reduce load}"
    
    simplifications:
      - "{What we simplified or cut}"
  
  skill_focus:
    primary_skill: "{Main capability user develops}"
    supporting_skills: ["{Related capabilities}"]
    tools_secondary: "{Tools are means to skill, not the focus}"
```

## Content Structure

### Step 5: Structural Order (Golden Circle)

```yaml
structural_order:
  section_why:
    purpose: "Emotional truth / Why user should care"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "{Opening hook}"
        rationale: "{Why this opens}"
      - order: 2
        element: "{Validation or aspiration}"
        rationale: "{Why this comes second}"
  
  section_how:
    purpose: "Method / Bridge from emotion to specifics"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "{Solution approach}"
        rationale: "{Why this bridges first}"
      - order: 2
        element: "{Key differentiator}"
        rationale: "{Why this matters here}"
      - order: 3
        element: "{Transformation path}"
        rationale: "{Why this comes last in HOW}"
  
  section_what:
    purpose: "Specifics / Proof / Action"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "{Product/offer name}"
        rationale: "{Why we can name it now}"
      - order: 2
        element: "{Social proof}"
        rationale: "{Why proof comes here}"
      - order: 3
        element: "{CTA}"
        rationale: "{Why action comes last}"
  
  flow_validation:
    feels_natural: "{yes/no + notes}"
    persuasive_arc: "{Does WHY → HOW → WHAT create emotional → logical → action flow?}"
```
