**Identify the natural starting point for your scenario**

## The Question

```
Agent: "Where does your primary target group first come into
        contact with this solution?"
```

---

## Why This Matters

The entry point determines:

- Where the scenario starts
- What mental state they're in
- What context you're designing for

**Common entry points:**

- Google search
- ChatGPT recommendation
- App store browsing
- Friend recommendation
- Social media ad
- Direct URL (returning user)

## Example: Dog Week

```
Designer: "Google search - they're frustrated with family conflict
           over dog care."
```

**Why this matters:**

- They're actively searching (high intent)
- They're frustrated (emotional state)
- They need immediate clarity (landing page critical)
