# 6. Create Value Trigger Chain for Scenario

**Purpose:** Crystallize scenario strategy before sketching

---

## Why Now?

You've defined:
- ✅ Feature that delivers value
- ✅ Entry point
- ✅ Mental state
- ✅ Mutual success
- ✅ Shortest path

**Perfect time to create a VTC** - you have everything needed.

This VTC will guide every page, every interaction, every word in this scenario.

## Agent Instructions

> "Before we start sketching, let's create a Value Trigger Chain for this scenario.
> 
> This captures the strategic essence:
> - Business Goal (from mutual success - business side)
> - Solution (this scenario/feature)
> - User (primary target group)
> - Driving Forces (from mental state and Trigger Map)
> - Customer Awareness (where they start → where they end up)
> 
> This takes 10-15 minutes since we have the Trigger Map. It'll guide every design decision.
> 
> Shall we create the scenario VTC?"

---

## Route to VTC Workshop

**If user agrees:**

Load and execute the VTC Workshop Router:
`../../shared/vtc-workshop/vtc-workshop-router.md`

**Since Trigger Map exists:** Router will likely send you to **Selection Workshop** (10-15 mins).

---

## Leverage Context

**Important:** You have rich context from scenario init! Use it:

- **Business Goal:** From mutual success (business side)
- **Solution:** The feature/scenario just defined
- **User:** Primary target group from Trigger Map
- **Entry Point/Mental State:** For Customer Awareness starting point
- **Mutual Success:** For Customer Awareness ending point
- **Driving Forces:** From Trigger Map for this user

**Scenario init IS strategic discovery** - use it!

---

## Save VTC

VTC should be saved to:
`{output_folder}/D-UX-Design/[scenario-name]/vtc.yaml`

Example: `docs/D-UX-Design/1.1-parent-onboarding/vtc.yaml`

---

## Confirm and Set Expectation

> "Excellent! This scenario now has its own VTC.
> 
> As we sketch each page, we'll use this VTC to ensure:
> - Every interaction addresses these driving forces
> - Every message moves them through awareness
> - Every design choice serves mutual success
> 
> The VTC is your strategic compass. When in doubt, check the VTC.
> 
> Ready to start sketching?"

## If User Declines VTC

**If user says:** "Let's skip the VTC and sketch"

**Response:**
> "I strongly recommend creating the VTC first. Here's why:
> 
> Without it, design becomes opinion-based:
> - 'I like this button here'
> - 'This color feels right'
> - 'Users probably want this'
> 
> With VTC, design becomes strategic:
> - 'This button triggers their wish to [driving force]'
> - 'This message addresses their fear of [driving force]'
> - 'This moves them from [awareness start] to [awareness end]'
> 
> It takes 15 minutes and saves hours of redesign.
> 
> Still want to skip?"

**If still declines:**
> "Okay, but I recommend creating VTC before presenting to stakeholders. You can add it anytime using:
> `../../shared/vtc-workshop/vtc-workshop-router.md`"

Then proceed to sketching without VTC (not ideal).

## Next Step

After VTC is created:

**Start sketching the scenario journey!**

Each sketch should:
- Serve the VTC driving forces
- Move user through awareness progression
- Support shortest path to mutual success

*Strategic clarity achieved - now sketch with purpose!*
