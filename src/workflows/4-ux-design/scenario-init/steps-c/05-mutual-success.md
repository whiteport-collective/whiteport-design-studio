# Question 4: What's the End Goal (Mutual Success)?

**Define winning for both business and user**

---

## The Question

```
Agent: "What does success look like for both sides?

        For the business: [what outcome?]
        For the user: [what state/feeling/outcome?]"
```

---

## Why This Matters

Success must be mutual:

- Business gets value
- User gets value
- Both are happy

**If only one side wins, the relationship fails.**

---

## Example: Dog Week

```
Designer: "Business: Active subscription
           User: Family harmony restored, dog gets walked consistently,
                 no more nagging needed"
```

**Why both matter:**

- Business needs subscription (revenue)
- User needs harmony (problem solved)
- Subscription only works if harmony is real
- Harmony only happens if product delivers

**Mutual success = sustainable business.**

## What Agent Captures

```
MUTUAL SUCCESS:

Business Goal: Active subscription (recurring revenue)
User Goal: Family harmony + consistent dog care + no nagging

Success Metric: User stays subscribed because harmony is real
Failure Point: User cancels if product doesn't reduce conflict
```
