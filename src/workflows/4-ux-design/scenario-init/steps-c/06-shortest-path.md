# Question 5: What's the Shortest Path?

**Map the minimum journey from starting point to mutual success**

---

## The Question

```
Agent: "Let's map the shortest possible journey from
        [starting point] to [mutual success]:

        What's the absolute minimum path?"
```

---

## Why This Matters

Shortest path means:

- No unnecessary steps
- No feature bloat
- Clear focus
- Faster to mutual success

**Every extra step is a chance to lose the user.**

---

## Example: Dog Week

```
Agent: "From 'frustrated parent on Google' to 'active subscription + harmony':
        What's the minimum path?"

Designer: "Google → Landing page → See how it works →
           Sign up → Set up family → Start using calendar →
           First walk completed → Everyone happy"
```

**Why this path:**

- Landing: Understand solution (addresses frustration)
- How it works: See it's simple (addresses complexity fear)
- Sign up: Commit to trying (low friction)
- Family setup: Get everyone involved (necessary for accountability)
- Calendar: Plan first week (immediate action)
- First walk: Proof it works (mutual success moment)

## What Agent Captures

```
SCENARIO: Parent Onboarding to First Success

START: Google search (frustrated, tired of nagging)
END: First walk completed (harmony, system working)

CRITICAL PATH:
1. Landing page → Understand solution
2. Sign up → Commit to trying
3. Family setup → Get everyone involved
4. Calendar → Plan first week
5. First walk → Proof it works

BUSINESS GOAL: Active subscription
USER GOAL: Family harmony without nagging

Each step serves the journey. Nothing extra.
```

## Next Step

With all 5 questions answered, you have:

- ✅ Core feature (what to design)
- ✅ Entry point (where to start)
- ✅ Mental state (how they feel)
- ✅ Mutual success (where to end)
- ✅ Shortest path (how to get there)

Before sketching, crystallize this scenario's strategy into a Value Trigger Chain.
