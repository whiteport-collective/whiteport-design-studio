# Question 1: What Feature Delivers the Most Value?

**Connect Trigger Map to the first thing you should design**

---

## The Question

```
Agent: "Looking at your Trigger Map and prioritized feature list,
        what's the core feature that delivers value to your
        primary target group?

        This is what we should sketch first."
```

---

## Why This Matters

Your Trigger Map already identified:

- Primary target group
- What triggers their need
- What outcome they want

**This question connects that to a specific feature to design.**

---

## Example: Dog Week

**From Trigger Map:**

- Target: Parents
- Trigger: Family conflict over dog care
- Outcome: Accountability without nagging

**Feature Selection:**

```
Designer: "The family dog walk calendar - it solves the accountability
           problem that causes conflict."
```

**Why this feature first:**

- Directly addresses the trigger (conflict)
- Serves the primary target group (parents)
- Delivers the desired outcome (accountability)

## What Agent Captures

```
CORE FEATURE: Family dog walk calendar
WHY: Solves accountability problem that causes family conflict
TARGET: Parents (primary decision makers)
```
