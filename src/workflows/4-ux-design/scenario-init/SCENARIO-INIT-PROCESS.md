# Scenario Initialization: From Trigger Map to First Sketch

**Find the natural starting point and shortest path to mutual success**

---

## The Situation

You've created your **Trigger Map**. You know:

- WHO your target groups are
- WHAT triggers their needs
- WHY your business exists

**Now: What should you start sketching?**

---

## Agent's Job: Help You Find the Journey

**Agent connects Trigger Map to the first scenario:**

### 1. What Feature Delivers the Most Value?

```
Agent: "Looking at your Trigger Map and prioritized feature list,
        what's the core feature that delivers value to your
        primary target group?

        This is what we should sketch first."

Designer: "The family dog walk calendar - it solves the accountability
           problem that causes conflict."
```

---

### 2. Where Does the User First Encounter This?

```
Agent: "Where does your primary target group first come into
        contact with this solution?"

Designer: "Google search - they're frustrated with family conflict
           over dog care."
```

---

### 3. What's Their Mental State at This Moment?

```
Agent: "When they find Dog Week on Google, how are they feeling?

        Think about:
        - What just happened? (trigger moment)
        - What are they hoping for?
        - What are they worried about?"

Designer: "Just had another fight about who walks the dog.
           Tired of nagging. Want a system that works without intervention.
           Worried about adding more complexity to family life."
```

---

### 4. What's the End Goal (Mutual Success)?

```
Agent: "What does success look like for both sides?

        For the business: [subscription purchased]
        For the parent: [what state/feeling/outcome]?"

Designer: "Business: Active subscription
           Parent: Family harmony restored, dog gets walked consistently,
                   no more nagging needed"
```

---

### 5. What's the Shortest Path?

```
Agent: "Let's map the shortest possible journey from
        'frustrated parent on Google' to 'active subscription + harmony':

        Natural starting point: Google search result

        What's the absolute minimum path to mutual success?"

Designer: "Google → Landing page → See how it works →
           Sign up → Set up family → Start using calendar →
           First walk completed → Everyone happy"
```

**Agent captures:**

```
SCENARIO: Parent Onboarding to First Success

START: Google search (frustrated, tired of nagging)
END: First walk completed (harmony, system working)

CRITICAL PATH:
1. Landing page (understand solution)
2. Sign up (commit to trying)
3. Family setup (get everyone involved)
4. Calendar (plan first week)
5. First walk (proof it works)

BUSINESS GOAL: Active subscription
USER GOAL: Family harmony without nagging

Now let's start sketching this journey.
```

## What This Gives You

**Clear foundation for sketching:**

- ✅ Natural starting point (where user actually is)
- ✅ Mental state (how they're feeling)
- ✅ End goal (mutual success defined)
- ✅ Shortest path (no unnecessary steps)
- ✅ WHY behind each step (trigger map connection)

**Now you can sketch with purpose:**

- Each page serves the journey
- Each feature addresses mental state
- Each step moves toward mutual success
- Nothing extra, nothing missing

---

## Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce (Sales Goal)

```
Business Goal: Product sales
Target Group: Budget-conscious customers
First Contact: Google search "affordable [product]"
Mental State: Anxious about hidden costs, need transparency
End Goal: Purchase completed, confident in value
Shortest Path: Google → Product page → Transparent pricing →
               Add to cart → Checkout → Confirmation

SCENARIO: Transparent Purchase Journey
```

---

### Example 2: SaaS (Subscription Goal)

```
Business Goal: Monthly subscriptions
Target Group: Small business owners
First Contact: ChatGPT recommendation
Mental State: Overwhelmed, need simple solution
End Goal: Active subscription, problem solved
Shortest Path: ChatGPT → Landing → See demo → Sign up →
               Quick setup → First success

SCENARIO: Frictionless Onboarding
```

---

### Example 3: Service Booking (Appointment Goal)

```
Business Goal: Consultation bookings
Target Group: First-time clients
First Contact: Friend recommendation
Mental State: Curious but cautious, need trust
End Goal: Appointment booked, feeling confident
Shortest Path: Friend link → About page → Testimonials →
               Book consultation → Confirmation

SCENARIO: Trust-Building Booking
```

## The Agent's Role

**Not a script. A conversation.**

Agent helps you think through:

- What drives the business?
- Who makes it happen?
- Where do they start?
- How do they feel?
- What's mutual success?
- What's the shortest path?

**Then you sketch with clarity.**

---

## Next Step

Once you have:

- ✅ Natural starting point
- ✅ Mental state
- ✅ End goal
- ✅ Shortest path

**Start sketching the journey.**

Each sketch serves the path from trigger to mutual success.
