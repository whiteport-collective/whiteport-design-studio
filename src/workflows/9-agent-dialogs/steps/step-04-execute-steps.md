# Step 4: Execute Steps

## CONTEXT

Step files are created. Now we execute each step, either in this dialog or in fresh agent dialogs.

---

## EXECUTION MODES

### Mode A: Continuous Execution
Execute all steps in the current session.
- ✅ Good for: Small implementations, full context available
- ❌ Risk: Context window limits, fatigue

### Mode B: Fresh Dialog Per Step
Start a new agent dialog for each step.
- ✅ Good for: Large implementations, complex steps
- ✅ Benefit: Fresh context, isolated focus
- ❌ Requires: Well-written self-contained step files

<ask>**Which execution mode?**

[A] Continuous — Execute steps in this session
[B] Fresh dialogs — I'll execute each step in a new dialog

Mode:</ask>

---

## MODE A: CONTINUOUS EXECUTION

### Execute Current Step

<action>
1. **Read the step file** completely
2. **Execute the implementation** following the instructions
3. **Verify against acceptance criteria**
4. **Test using the test instructions**
</action>

### Step Completion Checklist

- [ ] All objectives achieved
- [ ] Acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns

### Update Dialog File

<action>
**After completing each step:**

1. Update step status: 🔲 → ✅
2. Add notes if relevant
3. Add entry to Progress Log:
   ```
   ### {today's date}
   - Completed Step {N}: {step name}
   - {any notes or discoveries}
   ```
</action>

### Continue or Pause

<ask>**Step complete! What's next?**

[A] Continue to next step
[B] Pause — save progress and continue later
[C] Review what was done

Choice:</ask>

<check if="choice == A">
  <action>Load and execute next step file</action>
</check>

<check if="choice == B">
  <action>
  Update dialog file:
  - Status: "In Progress"
  - Progress Log: Note where we stopped

  Output: "Progress saved. The dialog is ready to resume."
  </action>
</check>

---

## MODE B: FRESH DIALOG INSTRUCTIONS

### For Each Step

<action>
**Generate handoff instructions:**

```
## Execute Step {N}: {Step Name}

### Context
This is part of the {feature-name} implementation.
Dialog: docs/F-Agent-Dialogs/{date}-{feature-name}/

### Instructions
1. Read the step file: `steps/{N}-{step-name}.md`
2. Execute the implementation
3. Verify against acceptance criteria
4. When complete, update the dialog file:
   - Change step status to ✅
   - Add entry to Progress Log

### Step File Location
`docs/F-Agent-Dialogs/{date}-{feature-name}/steps/{N}-{step-name}.md`
```
</action>

### Track Progress

<ask>**Step {N} — What's the status?**

[A] ✅ Complete — Move to next step
[B] 🔄 In Progress — Still working
[C] ⏸️ Blocked — Cannot proceed
[D] ❌ Skip — Will not implement

Status:</ask>

<action>Update dialog file with reported status</action>

---

## HANDLING ISSUES

### If Implementation Differs from Spec

<action>
Document in the dialog file's "Spec Changes Discovered" section:

| Issue | Resolution | Spec Updated? |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| {issue} | {how resolved} | 🔲 |
</action>

### If Step is Too Complex

<action>
Options:
1. Break into sub-steps (create additional step files)
2. Simplify scope (update dialog file)
3. Seek clarification (document blocker)
</action>

### If Blocked on Dependencies

<action>
1. Update step status: ⏸️ Blocked
2. Document the blocker in Notes
3. Move to next step if possible
4. Return to blocked step later
</action>

---

## PROGRESS TRACKING

### After Each Step

<action>
Update the Steps Overview table:

| # | Step | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Step name | ✅ | Completed |
| 2 | Step name | ✅ | Completed with minor changes |
| 3 | Step name | 🔄 | In progress |
| 4 | Step name | 🔲 | Not started |
</action>

### Progress Log Entry

<action>
Add to Progress Log:

```markdown
### {YYYY-MM-DD}
- Completed Step 1: {description}
- Completed Step 2: {description}
- Started Step 3
- Discovered: {any issues or learnings}
```
</action>

---

## ALL STEPS COMPLETE

<check if="all_steps_complete">
  <output>
  🎉 **All steps complete!**

  Proceed to Step 5 to finalize the dialog.

  [A] Continue to Step 5: Complete Dialog
  [B] Review the implementation first

  Choice:
  </output>
</check>

---

## ROUTING

<action>
Based on completion:
- All steps done → Load step-05-complete-dialog.md
- Steps remaining → Continue execution loop
- User pauses → Save state and exit
</action>
