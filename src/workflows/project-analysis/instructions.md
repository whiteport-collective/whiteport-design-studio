## What to Do

### Step 1: Show Your Presentation

Present your complete agent introduction:

- **Saga**: Load and present `src/modules/wds/agents/presentations/saga-presentation.md`
- **Idunn**: Load and present `src/modules/wds/agents/presentations/idunn-presentation.md`

**Why**: This establishes who you are before analyzing their project.
