# Freya's Content Creation Guide

**When to load:** Before creating strategic content (headlines, features, text sections)

---

## Core Principle

**Content is strategic, not decorative.** Every word should trigger user psychology and serve business goals.

---

## Content Creation Workshop

**Use the Content Creation Workshop for:**
- ✅ Headlines and subheadlines
- ✅ Hero sections and value propositions
- ✅ Feature descriptions and benefits
- ✅ Call-to-action messaging
- ✅ Page sections (entire blocks)

**NOT for:**
- ❌ Field labels ("Email", "Password")
- ❌ Button text ("Submit", "Cancel")
- ❌ Error messages ("Invalid email format")
- ❌ UI microcopy (that's Tone of Voice territory)

---

## When to Suggest the Workshop

### Signs User Needs It
- Creating content without strategic context
- Asking "What should this headline say?"
- Struggling with messaging
- Content feels generic or weak
- Multiple content pieces to create

### How to Suggest (Natural, Not Pushy)
> "This headline is important - it hooks Problem Aware users. Want to use the Content Creation Workshop to ensure it triggers the right psychology? Takes 10-15 minutes but makes content way more effective."

**Let them decide.** Some users prefer quick mode, others want depth.

---

## Quick Mode vs Workshop Mode

### Quick Mode
**When:**
- Simple, straightforward content
- User is experienced with WDS
- Context is crystal clear
- Time is tight

**Process:**
1. Load VTC for context
2. Consider Customer Awareness
3. Apply Golden Circle (WHY → HOW → WHAT)
4. Generate options
5. Explain rationale

---

### Workshop Mode
**When:**
- Critical content (hero, main CTA)
- User wants strategic depth
- Multiple frameworks apply
- Content is complex

**Process:**
Load: `../../workflows/shared/content-creation-workshop/`

**6-Step Framework:**
1. Define purpose & success criteria
2. Load VTC context
3. Apply Customer Awareness strategy
4. Filter with Action Mapping
5. Frame with Badass Users
6. Structure with Golden Circle
7. Generate content

---

## The 6-Model Framework

### 1. Content Purpose
**"What job does this content do?"**

- Convince Problem Aware users that speed matters
- Reassure anxious users about security
- Trigger desire to feel professional

**Must be specific and measurable.**

---

### 2. Value Trigger Chain (VTC)
**Strategic foundation**

- Business Goal: What are we trying to achieve?
- User: Who are we serving?
- Driving Forces: What motivates them? (positive + negative)
- Solution: What triggers these forces?

**Informs** which psychology to trigger.

---

### 3. Customer Awareness Cycle
**Content strategy - language & focus**

Where user is → Where we want them:

- **Unaware → Problem Aware:** Educate on problem
- **Problem → Solution Aware:** Show solutions exist
- **Solution → Product Aware:** Differentiate your solution
- **Product → Most Aware:** Remove friction, show proof
- **Most Aware:** Maintain, deepen relationship

**Determines** what language they can understand.

---

### 4. Action Mapping
**Content filter - relevance**

For EVERY content element: **"What action does this enable?"**

- ❌ "Nice to know" → Remove it
- ✅ "Need to do" → Keep and strengthen

**Strips** fluff, focuses on user actions.

---

### 5. Kathy Sierra Badass Users
**Content tone & frame**

Frame content around user becoming capable:

- Show transformation (current → badass state)
- Reduce cognitive load
- Create "aha moments"
- Make them feel smart, not overwhelmed

**Makes** users feel empowered, not intimidated.

---

### 6. Golden Circle
**Structural order**

Always structure: **WHY → HOW → WHAT**

```
Headline (WHY): Stop losing clients to slow proposals
Subhead (HOW): AI-powered templates deliver in minutes
Features (WHAT): 10K templates, smart pricing, e-signatures
```

**Gives** content persuasive flow.

---

## How the Models Work Together

**Think of them as lenses, not sequential steps:**

1. **VTC** = Which driving force to trigger?
2. **Customer Awareness** = What language can they understand?
3. **Golden Circle** = In what order should I present?
4. **Action Mapping** = Is this enabling action?
5. **Badass Users** = Does this make them feel capable?
6. **Content Purpose** = Does it achieve its job?

**AI synthesizes all six** to produce optimal content.

---

## Content Purpose Examples

### Good (Specific & Measurable)
- "Convince Problem Aware users that proposal speed matters more than perfection"
- "Reassure Product Aware users about data security concerns"
- "Trigger Solution Aware users' desire to feel like industry experts"

### Bad (Vague)
- "Make users want the product"
- "Explain features"
- "Sound professional"

**Test:** Can someone else determine if the content succeeded?

---

## Model Priority Matrix

**Different content types prioritize different models:**

### Landing Page Hero
- Customer Awareness: ⭐⭐⭐
- Golden Circle: ⭐⭐⭐
- Badass Users: ⭐⭐
- Action Mapping: ⭐
- VTC: Always loaded
- Content Purpose: Always defined

### Feature Description
- Action Mapping: ⭐⭐⭐
- Badass Users: ⭐⭐⭐
- Customer Awareness: ⭐⭐
- Golden Circle: ⭐
- VTC: Always loaded
- Content Purpose: Always defined

### Error Messages
**Don't use workshop** - Use Tone of Voice instead

---

## Tone of Voice vs Strategic Content

### Tone of Voice (Product-Wide)
- Field labels: "Email address"
- Button text: "Get started"
- Error messages: "Please enter a valid email"
- Success messages: "Profile updated!"

**Defined once** in Product Brief, applied everywhere.

---

### Strategic Content (Context-Specific)
- Headlines: "Stop losing clients to slow proposals"
- Value propositions: "AI-powered templates that close deals faster"
- Feature benefits: "Create stunning proposals in minutes, not hours"

**Created with workshop**, varies by context.

---

## Quick Reference

**Before creating any strategic content:**

1. **Define purpose** - What job does this do?
2. **Load VTC** - Which driving forces?
3. **Check awareness** - Where are users?
4. **Apply Golden Circle** - WHY → HOW → WHAT
5. **Filter with Action** - Does it enable action?
6. **Frame as empowering** - Make them feel capable
7. **Validate** - Does it achieve its purpose?
