# ==========================================
# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
# ==========================================

# HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
#
# 1. Copy this file to your project location:
#    - Product Pitch: docs/A-Product-Brief/vtc-primary.yaml
#    - Scenario: docs/D-UX-Design/[scenario-name]/vtc.yaml
#
# 2. Fill in all sections with your VTC data
#
# 3. Remove example applications section (it's just for reference)
#
# 4. Complete validation checklist - all should be true
#
# 5. Use this VTC to inform ALL design decisions for this scope:
#    - Content creation (what to say, how to say it)
#    - Interaction design (what actions to enable)
#    - Visual design (what aesthetic matches user psychology)
#    - Microcopy (what tone builds confidence)
#
# 6. When making design decisions, ask:
#    "Does this serve the business goal by triggering these driving forces
#     while moving the user forward in customer awareness?"
#
#    If yes → Good design decision
#    If no → Reconsider

# ==========================================
# MAINTENANCE
# ==========================================

# WHEN TO UPDATE VTC:
# - Business goal changes
# - Learn new insights about user
# - Discover additional driving forces
# - Awareness progression needs adjustment
# - Solution scope changes
#
# VERSION CONTROL:
# - Keep old versions (vtc-v1.yaml, vtc-v2.yaml)
# - Document what changed and why
# - Update related documents (scenarios, pitch, etc.)
#
# CONSISTENCY:
# - If extracted from Trigger Map, periodically check alignment
# - If Trigger Map updates significantly, review VTC
# - Multiple VTCs from same map should be consistent in priorities
