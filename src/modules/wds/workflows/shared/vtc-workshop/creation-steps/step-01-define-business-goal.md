# Step 1: Define Business Goal

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Purpose:** Establish what measurable outcome we want to achieve

---

## What You'll Do

Define one clear, measurable business goal that this solution serves.

---

## Questions to Ask User

> "What does success look like for the business? What measurable outcome do we want?"

**Follow-up if vague:**
- "Can we measure this?"
- "When would we know we've achieved it?"
- "What's the specific number or metric?"

---

## Guidelines

**Good goals are:**
- ✅ Specific and measurable
- ✅ Time-bound (if relevant)
- ✅ Achievable
- ✅ One primary goal (can mention secondary)

**Examples of GOOD goals:**
- "500 newsletter signups in Q1"
- "30% increase in premium conversions"
- "Reduce support tickets by 40%"
- "80% user activation rate"

**Examples of BAD goals:**
- "More engagement" (not measurable)
- "Better user experience" (vague)
- "Increase everything" (not focused)

---

## Capture Format

```yaml
business_goal: "[Specific, measurable outcome with timeframe if relevant]"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
business_goal: "500 newsletter signups in Q1"
```

---

## Validation Checklist

Before proceeding, confirm:

- [ ] Goal is measurable (has number/metric)
- [ ] Goal is specific (not vague)
- [ ] Goal is achievable (realistic)
- [ ] Goal is focused (one primary goal)
- [ ] User confirms this is the right goal

**If any checkbox is unchecked:** Refine the goal before proceeding.

## Common Issues

**Issue:** User provides multiple goals

**Solution:**
> "Let's pick ONE primary goal for this VTC. We can create additional VTCs for other goals. Which goal does THIS solution primarily serve?"

**Issue:** Goal is too vague ("better experience")

**Solution:**
> "How would we measure 'better'? What specific outcome would show we've succeeded?"

**Issue:** Goal is aspirational but not measurable ("be the leader")

**Solution:**
> "What metric would show we're the leader? Market share? Revenue? User count?"
