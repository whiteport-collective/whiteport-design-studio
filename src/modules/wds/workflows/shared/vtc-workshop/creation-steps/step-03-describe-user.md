# Step 3: Describe User

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Purpose:** Identify and describe the primary user with psychological depth

---

## What You'll Do

Create a rich description of ONE primary user who will use this solution.

---

## Questions to Ask User

> "Who is the primary user for this solution? Tell me about them."

**Follow-up questions:**
- "What's their role or context?"
- "What are their key traits or characteristics?"
- "When/where do they encounter this solution?"
- "What are they trying to accomplish?"

---

## Guidelines

**Go beyond demographics to psychology:**
- Not just "female, 35, urban"
- Include mindset, goals, context
- Make them feel like a real person

**Focus on ONE primary user:**
- Can add others later with separate VTCs
- Multiple users = multiple VTCs

---

## Template

```
[Name] ([role/context], [key traits])
Context: [when/where they encounter solution]
Current state: [what they're trying to accomplish]
```

**Example:**
```
Harriet (hairdresser, ambitious, small-town salon owner)
Context: Late evening, researching industry trends online
Current state: Wants to stay ahead of local competitors
```

---

## Capture Format

```yaml
user:
  name: "[Name or type]"
  description: "[Role, traits, context]"
  context: "[When/where they encounter solution]"
  current_state: "[What they're trying to accomplish]"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
user:
  name: "Harriet"
  description: "Hairdresser, ambitious, small-town salon owner"
  context: "Late evening, researching industry trends online"
  current_state: "Wants to stay ahead of local competitors"
```

---

## Validation Checklist

Before proceeding, confirm:

- [ ] Can you picture this person?
- [ ] Clear why they'd care about this solution?
- [ ] Understand what they're trying to achieve?
- [ ] Description feels real (not generic)?
- [ ] User confirms this matches their target?

---

## Common Issues

**Issue:** User gives demographics only ("women 25-45")

**Solution:**
> "Let's go deeper. Pick ONE person from that group. What's their name? What are they trying to achieve? What's their mindset?"

**Issue:** User wants multiple people

**Solution:**
> "For THIS VTC, let's focus on one primary user. We can create additional VTCs for other users. Who matters most for this solution?"

**Issue:** Too generic ("busy professional")

**Solution:**
> "Can you be more specific? What kind of professional? What makes them busy? What are they trying to accomplish?"

---

## Next Step

Once user is described and validated:

**→ Proceed to [Step 4: Identify Positive Driving Forces](./step-04-positive-driving-forces.md)**

---

## Output at This Point

You now have:
- ✅ Business goal
- ✅ Solution
- ✅ User description

Still need:
- ⏸️ Driving Forces (positive and negative)
- ⏸️ Customer Awareness
