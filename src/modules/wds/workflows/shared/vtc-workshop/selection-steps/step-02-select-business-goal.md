# Step 2: Select Business Goal

**Duration:** 2 minutes

**Purpose:** Choose which business goal from Trigger Map this VTC serves

---

## Present Available Goals

Show user all business goals from Trigger Map:

> "Your Trigger Map has these business goals:
> 
> 1. [Goal 1] - Priority: [score/rank]
> 2. [Goal 2] - Priority: [score/rank]
> 3. [Goal 3] - Priority: [score/rank]
> 
> Which goal does this [solution/scenario] primarily serve?"

---

## User Selects

**One primary goal** - This VTC will focus here

**Can note secondary:**
> "Does this also support another goal?"

If yes, capture but keep one primary.

---

## If Goal Not in Map

**User:** "Actually, none of these goals fit. This is about [different goal]."

**Options:**

**A) Add to Trigger Map now:**
1. Pause VTC workshop
2. Add new goal to Trigger Map
3. Resume with new goal available

**B) Add to VTC and note for map update:**
1. Use new goal in this VTC
2. Note: "Add to Trigger Map: [new goal]"
3. Update map in separate session

**C) Refine existing goal:**
1. Adjust wording for clarity
2. Use refined version in VTC
3. Consider updating map

**Recommendation:** If this is a significant gap, pause and update the Trigger Map. It will benefit all future VTCs.
