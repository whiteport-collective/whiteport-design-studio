# Step 5: Determine Structural Order

**Apply the Golden Circle to create persuasive content flow**

---

## Purpose

Simon Sinek's Golden Circle provides the structural order that makes content persuasive: **WHY → HOW → WHAT**. Most content does it backward (WHAT → HOW → WHY) and fails to inspire action. This step sequences your content for maximum impact.

---

## Duration

⏱️ **3-5 minutes**

---

## What You're Doing

Using the Golden Circle model to determine:
- The WHY-HOW-WHAT sequence for this content
- What content belongs in each section
- How to create a persuasive flow from motivation to action

---

## Context from Previous Steps

**VTC:** Business goal, user, driving forces  
**Awareness Strategy:** Language, information priorities, emotional journey  
**Action Filter:** Essential information that enables action  
**Empowerment Frame:** Transformation, capability framing, "aha moment"

---

## The Golden Circle (Quick Reference)

**Simon Sinek's Model:**

```
    WHY (Core)
     ↓
    HOW (Process)
     ↓
    WHAT (Proof)
```

**WHY** - The purpose, cause, belief
- Why does this matter?
- Why should the user care?
- What's the emotional truth?

**HOW** - The process, approach, differentiator
- How does this work?
- How do you do it differently?
- What's the method?

**WHAT** - The tangible, proof, specifics
- What exactly do you do/offer?
- What are the features?
- What's the concrete evidence?

**Key Insight:** Start with WHY (emotion/purpose), then HOW (method), then WHAT (specifics).

---

## Questions for the User

### 1. Identify the WHY

**"What's the emotional truth or purpose that opens this content?"**

The WHY connects to:
- User's driving forces (from VTC)
- Current emotional state (from Empowerment Frame)
- The problem or aspiration that matters

**Good WHY examples:**
- "Are your clients asking about trends you haven't heard of?" (emotional truth)
- "You deserve to feel ahead, not behind" (aspiration)
- "Every stylist feels this—you're not alone" (validation)

**Bad WHY examples:**
- "Our company was founded in 2018" (not emotional)
- "TrendWeek is a beauty newsletter" (WHAT, not WHY)
- "Sign up now" (jumping to action without motivation)

**"What's the opening that connects emotionally and makes them care?"**

### 2. Identify the HOW

**"What's the method or approach that bridges WHY to WHAT?"**

The HOW explains:
- How this solves the emotional need
- How you do it differently
- How the transformation happens

From previous steps, we have:
- Essential information (Action Filter)
- Capability framing (Empowerment Frame)

**"Which of these belongs in HOW—the bridging explanation?"**

**Example HOW content:**
- "Here's how stylists stay ahead: Weekly trend alerts delivered Monday morning"
- "60-second explainers—understand trends fast enough to use them same day"
- "Client conversation starters included—no guesswork"

### 3. Identify the WHAT

**"What are the concrete specifics and proof?"**

The WHAT provides:
- Specific features or offers
- Tangible evidence
- Social proof
- The ask/action

**"Which information belongs in WHAT—the concrete details?"**

**Example WHAT content:**
- "Join TrendWeek—Free for Stylists"
- "2,000 stylists already ahead"
- "Start Staying Ahead" (CTA button)
- "Free. Cancel anytime."

### 4. Map Content to Structure

**"Let's organize all our essential information into WHY-HOW-WHAT:"**

Present all the essential information from Step 3 (Action Filter) and capability framing from Step 4 (Empowerment Frame).

**Work together to assign each piece:**
- This goes in WHY (emotional opening)
- This goes in HOW (method/bridge)
- This goes in WHAT (specifics/proof)

### 5. Sequence Within Sections

**"Within each section, what's the most persuasive order?"**

Even within WHY, HOW, and WHAT, there's micro-sequencing:

**WHY section might be:**
1. Problem recognition (emotional hook)
2. Validation (you're not alone)
3. Aspiration (you can feel different)

**HOW section might be:**
1. Introduce solution approach
2. Explain key differentiator
3. Show transformation path

**WHAT section might be:**
1. Name the product/offer
2. Social proof
3. Clear CTA
4. Risk removal

**"What order within each section creates the smoothest flow?"**

### 6. Validate Persuasive Flow

**"Does this sequence feel natural and persuasive?"**

Read through the complete structure:
- WHY → [content]
- HOW → [content]
- WHAT → [content]

**"Does it flow logically from emotion → method → specifics?"**

**"Does anything feel out of order or jarring?"**

---

## Agent Actions

1. **Help user identify** the WHY (emotional truth/purpose)
2. **Help user identify** the HOW (method/bridge)
3. **Help user identify** the WHAT (specifics/proof)
4. **Map all essential information** from previous steps into WHY-HOW-WHAT
5. **Sequence content within sections** for smooth flow
6. **Validate persuasive flow** end-to-end
7. **Document the structure**

---

## Validation

Before proceeding to Step 6:

- [ ] WHY is identified (emotional opening, purpose)
- [ ] HOW is identified (method, bridge, differentiator)
- [ ] WHAT is identified (specifics, proof, CTA)
- [ ] All essential information assigned to WHY, HOW, or WHAT
- [ ] Content sequenced within each section
- [ ] Flow feels natural and persuasive (WHY → HOW → WHAT)
- [ ] Nothing feels out of order or premature

      - order: 1
        element: "[Opening hook]"

## Next Step

Once structure is determined:

**→ Proceed to [Step 6: Generate & Review Content](step-06-generate-content.md)**

---

## Example

**VTC Context:** Hairdresser newsletter signup

**Structural Order:**

```yaml
structural_order:
  section_why:
    purpose: "Emotional connection—problem recognition and aspiration"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "Headline: 'Are Your Clients Asking About Trends You Haven't Heard Of?'"
        rationale: "Opens with emotional pain point—immediate recognition"
      
      - order: 2
        element: "Subhead: 'Stop feeling behind. Become your town's go-to beauty authority.'"
        rationale: "Validation (you're not alone) + aspiration (badass state)"
      
      - order: 3
        element: "Visual: Split image—uncertain hairdresser → confident trendsetter"
        rationale: "Shows transformation visually, reinforces emotional journey"
  
  section_how:
    purpose: "Solution approach—how stylists stay ahead"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "Heading: 'Here's How Stylists Stay Ahead:'"
        rationale: "Introduces solution category (trend newsletters) to Problem Aware users"
      
      - order: 2
        element: "Weekly trend alerts delivered Monday morning"
        rationale: "Explains the method—simple, regular, manageable"
      
      - order: 3
        element: "60-second explainers—understand it fast"
        rationale: "Key differentiator—reduces cognitive load fear"
      
      - order: 4
        element: "Client conversation starters included"
        rationale: "Shows transformation path—immediate application"
  
  section_what:
    purpose: "Product naming, proof, and action"
    content_elements:
      - order: 1
        element: "Heading: 'Join TrendWeek—Free for Stylists'"
        rationale: "NOW we can name the product (moved to Product Aware)"
      
      - order: 2
        element: "2,000 stylists already ahead"
        rationale: "Social proof builds credibility before ask"
      
      - order: 3
        element: "Button: 'Start Staying Ahead'"
        rationale: "Capability-framed CTA (not 'sign up')"
      
      - order: 4
        element: "Subtext: 'Free. No credit card. Cancel anytime.'"
        rationale: "Risk removal last—addresses final barrier"
  
  flow_validation:
    feels_natural: "Yes—emotion → method → specifics flows smoothly"
    persuasive_arc: "WHY connects emotionally, HOW builds confidence, WHAT enables action without jumping too fast"
```

## Notes

- The Golden Circle is fractal—you can apply WHY-HOW-WHAT at page level AND within each section
- If WHAT comes before WHY, content feels salesy and pushy
- If WHY is missing, content feels cold and transactional
- The "aha moment" from Step 4 often lives in the HOW section (the insight that bridges emotion to action)
- This structure works for pages, sections, paragraphs, even sentences
