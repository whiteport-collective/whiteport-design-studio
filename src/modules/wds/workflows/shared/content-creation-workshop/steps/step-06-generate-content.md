# Step 6: Generate & Review Content

**Create content options and select the final version**

---

## Purpose

This is where the strategic work from Steps 1-5 becomes actual content. The agent generates 2-3 variations based on all the strategic context, and you select or combine them into the final version.

---

## Duration

⏱️ **5-10 minutes**

---

## What You're Doing

Using all strategic context to:
- Generate multiple content variations
- Present rationale for each variation
- Review and select the best approach
- Refine and finalize content

---

## Context from Previous Steps

**Step 1 - VTC Context:**
- Business goal, solution, user, driving forces, customer awareness

**Step 2 - Awareness Strategy:**
- Language guidelines, information priorities, emotional journey

**Step 3 - Action Filter:**
- Required action, essential information, barriers to address

**Step 4 - Empowerment Frame:**
- Transformation (current → badass), "aha moment," capability framing

**Step 5 - Structural Order:**
- WHY-HOW-WHAT sequence, content mapped to sections

---

## Agent Instructions

### 1. Synthesize All Context

Before generating, review and confirm you understand:
- [ ] WHO the user is and what drives them (VTC)
- [ ] WHERE they are in awareness (START → END)
- [ ] WHAT action this content must enable (Action Filter)
- [ ] HOW to make them feel capable (Empowerment Frame)
- [ ] WHAT order creates persuasive flow (Golden Circle)

### 2. Generate Multiple Variations

Create **2-3 content variations** that differ in:

**Variation A: Wish-Focused**
- Emphasizes positive driving forces
- Aspirational tone
- "Become the authority," "Stay ahead," "Impress your clients"

**Variation B: Fear-Focused**
- Addresses negative driving forces
- Problem-recognition tone
- "Stop feeling behind," "Never miss a trend," "No more embarrassment"

**Variation C: Balanced OR Awareness-Shifted** (choose one):
- **Balanced:** Combines wish + fear naturally
- **Awareness-Shifted:** Uses different starting awareness level (if user was uncertain)

**For each variation, include:**
- Complete content (headlines, body, CTA)
- Rationale explaining the approach
- Why this might resonate

### 3. Present Variations Clearly

Use this format:

```markdown
---

## Variation A: [Name - e.g., "Wish-Focused"]

### Rationale
[Why this approach, what driving force it emphasizes, when this works best]

### Content

**WHY Section:**
[Content for WHY]

**HOW Section:**
[Content for HOW]

**WHAT Section:**
[Content for WHAT]

### Why This Might Resonate
[Specific user insight or context that makes this effective]

---

## Variation B: [Name]
[Same structure]

---

## Variation C: [Name]
[Same structure]

---
```

### 4. Explain Strategic Choices

For each variation, show how you applied the strategic context:
- "This opens with [X] because the user is Problem Aware—they need problem validation first"
- "This uses 'you'll be able to' framing because of Badass Users principle"
- "This puts social proof before CTA because Action Filter identified trust as a barrier"

**Make the strategy visible.**

---

## Questions for the User

### 1. Initial Reaction

**"Which variation resonates most with you?"**

- Variation A (wish-focused)?
- Variation B (fear-focused)?
- Variation C (balanced/awareness-shifted)?
- Combination of elements?

### 2. Alignment Check

**"Does this feel aligned with the strategic context?"**

- Does it serve the VTC's business goal?
- Does it speak to the user's driving forces?
- Does it meet them at their awareness level?
- Does it enable the required action?
- Does it frame around capability?
- Does it follow WHY → HOW → WHAT?

### 3. Refinement

**"What would you adjust or combine?"**

- Headline from A, but body from B?
- Stronger emphasis on X?
- Softer tone on Y?
- Add/remove specific element?

### 4. Missing Anything?

**"Is anything missing that we identified in previous steps?"**

Check against:
- Essential information (Step 3)
- Barriers to address (Step 3)
- "Aha moment" (Step 4)
- Cognitive load reductions (Step 4)

### 5. Awareness Journey Validation

**"Does this move the user from START → END awareness?"**

- At START, can they understand the opening?
- By END, have they reached the target awareness level?
- Is the journey smooth or jarring?
