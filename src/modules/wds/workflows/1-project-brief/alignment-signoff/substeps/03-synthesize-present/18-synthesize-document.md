# Substep 18: Synthesize Alignment Document

**Purpose**: Create the alignment document from all explored sections

---

## Instruction

**After confirming understanding**:

Help crystallize into a clear, compelling narrative using framework thinking:
- **Realization → Why It Matters → How We See It Working → Value We'll Create**
- **Realization → Agitate (Cost of Inaction) → Solve (Solution) → Commitment**

**Framework check**: Does the alignment document flow logically?
- Realization is clear and evidence-backed
- Why it matters and who we help is understood
- Solution addresses the realization
- Commitment is reasonable and risks acknowledged
- Cost of inaction makes the case
- Value we'll create justifies the commitment

**Create Alignment Document**

**Output file**: `docs/1-project-brief/pitch.md` (deliverable name: "pitch")

**Format**: Clear, brief, readable in 2-3 minutes

**Structure**: Use the 10-section structure covered in the exploration

**Template reference**: `src/modules/wds/workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/pitch.template.md`

**Ask**: "Does this present your idea in the best light?"
