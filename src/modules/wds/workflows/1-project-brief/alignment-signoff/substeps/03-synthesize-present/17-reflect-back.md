# Substep 17: Reflect Back What You've Captured

**Purpose**: Reflect back understanding before synthesizing

---

## Instruction

**After covering all sections** (in whatever order made sense):

Reflect back what you've captured:

"I've explored [list sections covered] with you. Let me reflect back what I understand:

- **The Realization**: [summarize their realization]
- **Why It Matters**: [summarize why it matters and who we help]
- **How We See It Working**: [summarize solution approach]
- **Recommended Solution**: [summarize preferred approach]
- **The Path Forward**: [summarize work approach]
- **The Value We'll Create**: [summarize value and success metrics]
- **Cost of Inaction**: [summarize consequences]
- **Our Commitment**: [summarize resources and risks]
- **Summary**: [summarize key points]

Does this capture what you want in your alignment document? Anything you'd like to adjust or clarify?"
