# Substep 18.5: Create Value Trigger Chain

**Purpose**: Create a simplified VTC to strengthen the pitch with strategic clarity

---

## Instruction

**After creating the alignment document**:

"Before we present this for approval, let's create a Value Trigger Chain (VTC) to add strategic clarity to your pitch.

A VTC is a simplified strategic summary that captures:
- **Business Goal** - What measurable outcome you want
- **Solution** - What you're building
- **User** - Who the primary user is
- **Driving Forces** - What motivates them (positive + negative)
- **Customer Awareness** - Where they start and where you move them

This takes about 20-30 minutes and gives stakeholders a clear, strategic view of the project. It will be added to your pitch document.

Shall we create the VTC now?"

## If User Agrees

Load and execute the VTC Workshop Router:
`../../../shared/vtc-workshop/vtc-workshop-router.md`

**Note:** At pitch stage, there's typically NO Trigger Map yet, so router will likely send you to the **Creation Workshop**.

### Leverage Pitch Context

**Important:** You have extensive context from the pitch sections! Use it:

- **Business Goal:** From "Value We'll Create" and "Why It Matters"
- **Solution:** From "Recommended Solution"
- **User:** From "Why It Matters" (who we help)
- **Driving Forces:** Infer from "Why It Matters" and "Cost of Inaction"
- **Customer Awareness:** Infer from "The Realization" and solution approach

**Don't start from zero** - use the strategic work already completed.

### Save VTC

VTC should be saved to:
`docs/1-project-brief/vtc-primary.yaml`

### Add VTC to Pitch

After VTC is created, add it to the pitch document using the template placeholders.

## If User Declines

**If user says:** "Let's skip the VTC for now"

**Response:**
> "No problem! You can create a VTC later using:
> `src/modules/wds/workflows/shared/vtc-workshop/vtc-workshop-router.md`
> 
> However, I recommend creating it before presenting to stakeholders. It takes 30 minutes and provides powerful strategic clarity that helps secure buy-in.
> 
> You can also add it after stakeholder feedback if needed."

Then proceed to next step.
