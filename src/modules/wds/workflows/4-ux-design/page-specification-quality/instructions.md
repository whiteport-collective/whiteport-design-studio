**Purpose:** Ensure every page specification follows WDS standards with complete structure, Object IDs, and traceability.

**Use Cases:**
1. **During Page Creation** - Build specs correctly from the start
2. **After Page Updates** - Validate changes maintain standards
3. **Quality Audit** - Check existing specs for missing elements
