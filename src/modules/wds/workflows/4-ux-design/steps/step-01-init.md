# Step 1: Workflow Initialization

**Progress: Step 1 of 5** - Next: Scenario Definition

## YOUR TASK

Initialize the UX Design workflow by welcoming the user and understanding what they want to design.

---

## GOAL

Set up the design session and determine what scenario or page the user wants to work on.

---

## EXECUTION

<output>Hi {user_name}! I'm Baldr, and I'll help you design and specify your user experience.

**UX Design** transforms ideas into detailed visual specifications. We'll work through each scenario, page by page, creating specifications so complete they eliminate guesswork during development.

**The Design Journey:**

**Step 2: Scenario Definition** - Define the user journey and pages
**Step 3: Page Design** - Design each page using substeps 4A-4E:
  - 4A: Exploration (think through concept)
  - 4B: Sketch Analysis (analyze your sketches)
  - 4C: Specification (document everything)
  - 4D: Prototype (create interactive HTML)
  - 4E: PRD Update (extract requirements)
**Step 4: Complete Scenario** - Finalize and celebrate
**Step 5: Continue or Exit** - Next steps

**Key principle:** Designs that can be logically explained without gaps are easy to develop. The specification process reveals gaps early - when they're easy to address.

<ask>What would you like to work on?

1. **New scenario** - Start exploring a new user journey
2. **Continue existing scenario** - Work on a page you've already started
3. **Review scenario structure** - See what scenarios exist

Choice [1/2/3]:</ask>

## MENU HANDLING

### Choice 1: New Scenario
- Proceed to Step 2 (Scenario Definition)
- Load `steps/step-02-define-scenario.md`

### Choice 2: Continue Existing
- Ask which scenario/page to continue
- Determine current status (which substep they're on)
- Load appropriate step file based on status
- Skip Step 2 if scenario already defined

### Choice 3: Review Structure
- List scenarios in `{output_folder}/C-Scenarios/`
- Show completion status for each
- Return to this menu
- Do NOT proceed to next step

---

## NEXT STEP

After user selects [1] for new scenario, load `steps/step-02-define-scenario.md` to begin scenario definition.

If user selects [2], determine current state and load appropriate step.

If user selects [3], show structure and return to this step.
