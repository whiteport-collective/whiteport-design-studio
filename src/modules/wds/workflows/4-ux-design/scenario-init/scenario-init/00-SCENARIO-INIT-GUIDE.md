# Scenario Initialization Guide

**From Trigger Map to first sketch**

---

## Purpose

You've created your Trigger Map. Now: **What should you start sketching?**

This process helps you identify:

- The core feature to design first
- The natural starting point
- The user's mental state
- The shortest path to mutual success

---

## The 6 Steps

### [1. What Feature Delivers Value?](01-feature-selection.md)

Which core feature serves your primary target group?

### [2. Where Do They Encounter It?](02-entry-point.md)

Where does the user first come into contact with your solution?

### [3. What's Their Mental State?](03-mental-state.md)

How are they feeling at this moment?

### [4. What's Mutual Success?](04-mutual-success.md)

What does winning look like for both business and user?

### [5. What's the Shortest Path?](05-shortest-path.md)

Minimum steps from starting point to mutual success

### [6. Create Value Trigger Chain](06-create-vtc.md)

Crystallize scenario strategy before sketching
