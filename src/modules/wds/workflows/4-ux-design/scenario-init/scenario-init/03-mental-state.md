# Question 3: What's Their Mental State at This Moment?

**Understand the emotional context for design decisions**

---

## The Question

```
Agent: "When they find your solution, how are they feeling?

        Think about:
        - What just happened? (trigger moment)
        - What are they hoping for?
        - What are they worried about?"
```

---

## Why This Matters

Mental state determines:

- Tone of content
- Complexity of interface
- Type of features needed
- What NOT to do

**Design for the human, not just the task.**

---

## Example: Dog Week

```
Designer: "Just had another fight about who walks the dog.
           Tired of nagging. Want a system that works without intervention.
           Worried about adding more complexity to family life."
```

**Design implications:**

- Tone: Empathetic, not preachy
- Interface: Simple, not complex
- Features: Automated accountability, not more work
- Avoid: Notifications that feel like nagging

## What Agent Captures

```
MENTAL STATE:
- Trigger: Just had family fight
- Feeling: Tired, frustrated
- Hope: System that works without intervention
- Fear: Adding more complexity

DESIGN IMPLICATIONS:

```
