# Figma to Code Workshop

**Status:** Coming Soon

**Purpose:** Extract design specifications from Figma and implement them in code

**Tool:** Figma Desktop MCP Server  
**Direction:** Figma → Code

---

## Overview

This workshop will guide AI agents through importing design specifications from Figma to generate or update code implementations.

### When to Use Figma to Code

Import from Figma when:
- ✅ Designer has updated visual specifications in Figma
- ✅ New design system components need implementation
- ✅ Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) need extraction
- ✅ Component states have been refined visually
- ✅ Design-code sync is needed after visual iteration

---

## Planned Workflow

1. **Connection Check** - Verify Figma Desktop MCP server
2. **Select Figma Node** - Identify what to import
3. **Extract Design Specs** - Get colors, spacing, typography, layout
4. **Generate/Update Code** - Create or update components
5. **Verify Implementation** - Compare code output to Figma design

*This workshop will be developed to complement the Code to Figma workflow.*
