# Code to Figma Workshop - Entry Point

**Purpose:** Send code implementations to Figma for design review, documentation, and visual iteration

**Tool:** html.to.design MCP Server  
**Direction:** Code → Figma

---

## Overview

This workshop guides AI agents through sending code to Figma using a **specification-driven approach** where component naming and structure are derived from project specifications.

### When to Send Code to Figma

Send code to Figma when:
- ✅ Component states need visual documentation (hover, active, disabled, etc.)
- ✅ Design system components require Figma library representation
- ✅ Prototype pages need designer review and feedback
- ✅ Visual adjustments are easier to iterate in Figma than code
- ✅ Design-code parity documentation is needed

---

## Agent Instructions

**Execute steps sequentially. Do not skip steps.**

Each step:
1. Completes one atomic task
2. Validates before proceeding
3. Captures output for next step
4. Moves to next step ONLY when complete

**Do not look ahead. Execute one step at a time.**

## Workshop Structure

**Step 1: Connection Check** (~5-10 min)
- Verify MCP connection and guide setup if needed

**Step 2: Identify Export Type** (~2-3 min)
- Determine what type of export (prototype page, design system component, or frontend view)

**Step 3: Prepare Specifications** (~5-15 min)
- Find or create specifications with OBJECT IDs for proper Figma naming

**Step 4: Generate & Validate** (~5-10 min)
- Generate Figma-compatible HTML and validate before export

**Step 5: Execute Export** (~2-5 min)
- Execute export and verify success in Figma
