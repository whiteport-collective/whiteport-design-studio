- ✅ **[Number] [champions]** (THE ENGINE - [Persona] becomes one of them naturally)
- ✅ [Action 1]
- ✅ [Action 2]
- ✅ [Natural outcome]
- **Timeline: [X] months**
- **This drives ALL other objectives**

**🚀 SECONDARY: [Champions] Drive [Product] Adoption → Achieves:**
- ✅ [Objective 1] ([champions] spread the word)
- ✅ [Objective 2] ([champions] demonstrate value)
- ✅ [Objective 3] ([champions] create engagement)
- **Timeline: [X] months**

**🌟 TERTIARY: [Product] Success Creates Opportunities for Community → Achieves:**
- ✅ [Opportunity 1] (members [benefit])
- ✅ [Opportunity 2] (members [benefit])
- ✅ [Opportunity 3] (members [benefit])
- **Timeline: [X] months**
- **Benefit: [Impact on members' lives/careers]**

**The Trigger Map IS the Strategic Foundation - And Prioritization Matters**

The page must empower [Primary Persona] → make [them] awesome → [they] naturally become [champions] → [champions] drive adoption → adoption creates opportunities for all members.
