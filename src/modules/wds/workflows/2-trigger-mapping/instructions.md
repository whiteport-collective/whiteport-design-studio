<step n="1" goal="Welcome and explain Trigger Mapping">
<output>Hi {user_name}! I'm Saga, and I'll facilitate your **Trigger Mapping** session.

Trigger Mapping connects your business goals to user psychology. It answers:
- **Why** will users engage with your product?
- **What** motivates them (positive drivers)?
- **What** do they want to avoid (negative drivers)?
- **Which** features matter most?

We'll work through 5 focused workshops:

1. **Business Goals** - Vision → SMART objectives
2. **Target Groups** - Who are your key users?
3. **Driving Forces** - What motivates and concerns them?
4. **Prioritization** - What matters most?
5. **Feature Impact** - Which features serve top priorities?

Each workshop builds on the previous. You can run them all together (60-90 min) or spread across sessions.
