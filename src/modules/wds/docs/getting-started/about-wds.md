# About WDS

**What is Whiteport Design Studio?**

---

## Overview

**Whiteport Design Studio (WDS)** is a design methodology that makes designers indispensable in the AI era.

**The paradigm shift:**

- The design becomes the specification
- The specification becomes the product
- The code is just the printout

---

## Who Created It?

**Mårten Angner** - UX designer and founder of Whiteport, a design and development agency in Sweden.

After years of working with AI tools, Mårten observed that traditional design handoffs were breaking down. Designers would create mockups, hand them off to developers, and watch their intent get lost in translation.

WDS solves this by preserving design thinking through AI-ready specifications.

---

## Why It Exists

**The problem:** AI can generate code perfectly, but only if you can clearly define what you want. Unclear specifications lead to AI hallucinations and failed projects.

**The solution:** WDS teaches designers to create conceptual specifications that capture intent, not just appearance.

**The result:** Designers become 5x more productive while maintaining creative control.

## How It Works

WDS provides:

- A systematic workflow from product brief to AI-ready specifications
- Conceptual specifications (WHAT + WHY + WHAT NOT TO DO)
- AI agents specifically tailored for design work
- Integration with BMad Method for seamless design-to-development handoff

---

## Free and Open-Source

WDS is completely free and open-source:

- No cost barriers or subscriptions
- AI agents included
- Community-driven development
- Plugin module for BMad Method

**Mission:** Give designers everywhere the tools to thrive in the AI era.
