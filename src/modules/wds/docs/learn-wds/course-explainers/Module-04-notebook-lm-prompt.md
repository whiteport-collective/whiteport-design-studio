## Prompt

Create an engaging 25-30 minute podcast conversation between two hosts discussing Module 04 of the Whiteport Design Studio (WDS) course: Product Brief.

**IMPORTANT: WDS stands for Whiteport Design Studio - always refer to it by its full name "Whiteport Design Studio" or "WDS" throughout the conversation.**

**Host 1 (The Curious Designer):** A designer ready to start a project and wants to understand the practical process.

**Host 2 (The Practical Guide):** A designer who uses the Product Brief as a living reference throughout every project phase.

**Conversation structure:**

### 1. Opening (2 min) - What Is This?

The Curious Designer: "I'm starting a new project and I keep hearing about this Product Brief. What exactly is it?"

The Practical Guide: "It's a 2-3 page document that answers 5 critical questions: What are we building and why? Who is it for? How will we know it's successful? What else exists? What are our constraints? That's it. Simple, but it changes everything."

The Curious Designer: "Okay, but why do I need it?"

The Practical Guide: "Because every time you activate an agent in WDS - whether you're analyzing requirements, sketching interfaces, or writing content - that agent reads your Product Brief first. It's how they understand your project. It's your project's foundation, living right in your repo alongside your code."

### 2. How It's Actually Used (5 min)

The Curious Designer: "So when do I actually use this document?"

The Practical Guide: "Every single time you work on the project. Let me show you:

When you activate Saga to analyze user needs - she reads the Product Brief to understand your vision and target users.

When you activate Sketch to create wireframes - he reads the Product Brief to understand constraints and success criteria.

When you activate Lyra to write content - she reads the Product Brief to match your tone and positioning.

Every agent starts by reading your Product Brief. It's how they stay aligned with your project's foundation."

The Curious Designer: "Wait, so it's not just a planning document I create and forget about?"

The Practical Guide: "Exactly! It's a living reference. And here's the key: it lives in your IDE, right in your project repo. Not on some server somewhere. Not in a Google Doc. Right there in `/docs/A-Product-Brief/product-brief.md` - one click away from your developers, your designers, your entire team."

### 3. Creating It - The Actual Process (8 min)

The Curious Designer: "Okay, I'm sold. How do I create this thing?"

The Practical Guide: "After you create your repo in Module 02, you activate Saga the Analyst. She'll see the Product Brief is missing and just start the conversation. It's that simple."

The Curious Designer: "What does that conversation actually sound like?"

The Practical Guide: "Let me give you real examples. Saga asks questions like:

'What problem are you solving with this product?'

You might say: 'Families struggle to coordinate schedules and responsibilities. Everyone's confused about who's doing what.'

Saga reflects back: 'So you're seeing families deal with coordination chaos - unclear responsibilities and missed commitments. Is that right?'

You confirm, and she captures it in the vision section.

Then she asks: 'Who specifically is this for?'

You say: 'Parents managing households - they're the ones coordinating everything.'

Saga digs deeper: 'What about their situation makes this hard for them specifically?'

You think out loud: 'They're juggling work, kids' activities, household tasks. Everything's in different apps or just in their heads.'

Saga captures that, then asks: 'How will you know this is working for them?'

You might start vague: 'They'll be less stressed.'

Saga prompts: 'Let's make that measurable. What would less stress look like in numbers?'

You refine: 'Reduce missed commitments by 50% in the first month. Achieve a satisfaction score of 8/10 or higher.'

Saga writes it down as a SMART goal.

See the pattern? She asks, you think out loud, she reflects back to confirm, then captures it. You're thinking together."

The Curious Designer: "And this is all happening in my IDE?"

The Practical Guide: "Yes! You're watching the document build in real-time in your code editor. Not in some separate tool. Right there in your project. When Saga asks about constraints, you mention you need to launch in 3 months with a small team. She captures that in the constraints section. When you talk about competitors, she structures it in the competitive landscape section. You're just having a conversation, and the document is writing itself."

### 4. The 5 Questions (Quick Overview) (3 min)

The Curious Designer: "You mentioned 5 questions. What are they?"

The Practical Guide: "Here they are:

1. **What & Why** - Your vision and positioning. What problem are you solving and why does it matter?

2. **Who** - Your target users. Primary users, secondary users, stakeholders. Be specific.

3. **How We'll Know** - Success criteria. Measurable outcomes. Not 'make it better' but 'reduce missed commitments by 50% in month one.'

4. **Context** - Competitive landscape. What else exists? How are you different?

5. **Boundaries** - Constraints. Technical, business, design. What are your limits?

That's it. Saga walks you through each one. You just answer honestly, she helps you refine it, and captures it in the document."

### 5. The Human-in-the-Loop Approach (4 min)

The Curious Designer: "This sounds different from other AI tools. What makes it different?"

The Practical Guide: "It's the human-in-the-loop thinking partnership - inherited from the BMad methodology. Most AI tools either replace you or just take orders. WDS works differently.

You bring: Your vision, domain expertise, understanding of your users.
Saga brings: Structure, methodology, the right questions at the right time.

You're not prompting an AI. You're not filling out a form. You're having a conversation with a thinking partner who helps you clarify what's in your head and ensures nothing important gets missed.

This is where you first experience what 'writing together' actually means. You stay in strategic thinking mode. Saga captures and structures your insights. You see the document building in real-time. You refine together.

The result is truly yours - just better articulated."

### 6. How to Actually Do This (3 min)

The Curious Designer: "Okay, I'm ready. What's the actual process?"

The Practical Guide: "After you create your repo in Module 02:

1. Open your IDE
2. Activate Saga: `@wds-saga project-brief`
3. She sees the Product Brief is missing
4. She starts the conversation
5. You answer her questions
6. She writes the document in real-time
7. You review and refine together
8. Done

It's that simple. The document lives in `/docs/A-Product-Brief/product-brief.md` in your repo. Not on a server. Not in a separate tool. Right there with your code.

And from that point forward, every agent you activate reads it first. When you work on user research, wireframes, content, technical architecture - they all start by understanding your Product Brief. It's your project's foundation."

---

### 7. Closing (2 min)

The Curious Designer: "This makes so much sense. Why haven't I been doing this?"

The Practical Guide: "Because it used to be hard. Now it's just a conversation. Create your repo, activate Saga, talk it out. You'll have your strategic foundation, living in your IDE, referenced by every agent, guiding every decision.

That's Module 04. Go create your Product Brief. Your future self will thank you."
