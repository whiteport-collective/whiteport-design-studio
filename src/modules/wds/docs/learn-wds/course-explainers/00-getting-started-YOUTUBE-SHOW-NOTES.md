## 💡 The Choice

You're standing at the most important moment in design history.

**Factory work** - comfortable, familiar, but AI is getting better every day  
**Linchpin work** - strategic, irreplaceable, where your brilliance becomes immortal

The question isn't whether AI will change design - it already has.

The question is: **Which side of the line are you on?**

---

**Remember:**
- The design becomes the specification
- The specification becomes the product
- The code is just the printout
