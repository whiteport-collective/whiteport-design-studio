**IMPORTANT: Use the reference image as your exact style guide. Match all visual elements, colors, layout, and character design.**

Create a 1920x1080px YouTube thumbnail matching the reference image style.

**What to Change from Reference:**

**Headlines (Left side):**
- Line 1: "TRIGGER MAPPING" (Rubrik Light, 91pt, white)
- Line 2: "YOUR ONE SLIDE STRATEGY" (Rubrik Bold, 91pt, white)
- Line 3: "FOR ANY DIGITAL PROJECT!" (Rubrik Bold, 91pt, white)
- Line spacing: 79pt

**Module Badge (Bottom-left):**
- "05 Trigger Mapping" (Rubrik Regular, 108pt, white on red #ff1744)

**Character Activity:**
- Keep the woman's angle and position similar as in the first reference image. Keep the character neutral and stylized as it is
- Woman is working with a large visual trigger map spread out in front of her
- She's connecting elements on the map with lines/arrows, showing strategic connections
- On the desk: sticky notes with "Business Goals", "Target Groups", "Drivers" visible as labels
- Expression: focused and strategic, making connections
- Skip the tablet

**Background Pattern:**
- Clear the background from previous objects except the globe
- Add oversized and toned down strategic mapping elements (connected nodes, mind-map branches, arrows showing flow, target/bullseye icons)
- Keep as in reference image

**Workspace Props:**
- Add: large trigger map diagram (visible strategic layers), sticky notes with labels, markers/pens, coffee cup, notebook
- The map should show visual hierarchy: center node with radiating connections
- No text should be visible or be presented with just scribble or gray markers

**Keep Everything Else from Reference:**
- do not put light objects behind her face since we need to keep her silhouette clear
- Top-right branding text
- Character design and style
- Color scheme and layout
