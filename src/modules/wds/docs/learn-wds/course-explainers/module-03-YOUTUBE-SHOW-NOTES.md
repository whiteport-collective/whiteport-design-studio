3. **Create alignment document** - Build pitch based on what they told you
4. **Presentation meeting** - Share proposal showing you understood them
5. **Iterate** - Negotiate and refine together
6. **Get acceptance** - They say yes to the pitch
7. **Generate signoff** - Create contract based on accepted pitch
