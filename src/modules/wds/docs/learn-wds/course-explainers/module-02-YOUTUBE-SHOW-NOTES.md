Sound familiar? You're not alone. Every designer was once exactly where you are now.

✅ Installing your IDE workspace (Cursor or VS Code)
✅ Cloning your project to your computer
✅ Adding WDS to your workspace
✅ Meeting Mimir - your personal WDS guide

This isn't about becoming technical. This is about getting your professional environment set up so you can focus on what matters: designing with confidence.

**Total setup time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Computer + Internet + Email  
**Technical experience required:** None  
**Format:** Video walkthrough + detailed written lessons with checklists

## Repository Structure Decision

**Single Repository** (`my-project`)
- Specs + code together
- Use when: Small team, building yourself, simple communication

**Separate Specifications Repository** (`my-project-specs`)
- Specs only, separate code repo
- Use when: Corporate, many developers, clear handoff needed

**Name your repository based on your choice!**

📁 **1-project-brief** - Vision and strategy

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**  
A: No! You're setting up a workspace, not learning to code.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**  
A: GitHub is your time machine - you can always go back. And Mimir is always available to help.

**Q: Do I need to manually install Git?**  
A: Nope! Modern IDEs auto-install Git when you need it.

**Q: Can I use VS Code instead of Cursor?**  
A: Absolutely! Both work great. Cursor is optimized for AI work, but VS Code is excellent too.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Type `@wds-mimir [your question]` in your AI chat. He's always there to help.

**Q: Single repo or separate specs repo?**  
A: Most beginners should use single repo. It's simpler and you can always split later.

- If you can do this, you can master WDS

**You're not a beginner anymore. You're a designer with a professional setup.**
