1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,915
All right, let's dive into something

2
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:04,363
that, let's be honest, can feel a little

3
00:00:04,363 --> 00:00:06,504
intimidating for a lot of designers. The

4
00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:08,340
whole technical setup for the Whiteboard

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,481
Design Studio course, we're going to go

6
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:13,234
on a little journey here and the goal is

7
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,681
to take that feeling of, uh, this is

8
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:18,129
complicated and turn it into, OK, I got

9
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,647
this. Does this sound at all familiar?I

10
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:22,861
bet it does. This is probably the number

11
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,798
one thing we hear from amazing designers

12
00:00:24,798 --> 00:00:27,012
who are totally ready to grow, but they

13
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:29,226
feel like the tools are this giant wall

14
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:31,717
in front of them. If that's you, I just

15
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:34,485
want you to know you are so not alone. In

16
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:36,975
fact, this is the perfect place for us to

17
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,913
start. And here's the absolute truth. The

18
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,559
thing you have to keep in mind?Every

19
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,656
single expert you admire, every designer

20
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:46,452
who seems to have it all figured out.

21
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,549
They all started right here, uncertain,

22
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,995
maybe a little nervous, wondering if they

23
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:53,791
could really get the hang of it. Well,

24
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,587
they did, and you will too. So let's

25
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:59,033
just face that technical hurdle head on.

26
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,615
Our first mission is super simple. We're

27
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:03,819
going to demystify all these tools. We're

28
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,024
going to take that scary sounding jargon

29
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,228
and justice, turn it into ideas that

30
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:10,433
actually make sense. First U Git and

31
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,952
GitHub, people get these mixed U all the

32
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:15,157
time. Are they the same thing? Not

33
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:17,991
really. And the best way to get it is

34
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:20,510
with this analogy. Think of Git as the

35
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,566
engine. It's the powerful. Thing working

36
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,071
behind the scenes, keeping track of every

37
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:27,576
single change you make. And GitHub, well,

38
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:30,081
GitHub is the car. It's the sleek,

39
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:31,870
user-friendly website where you actually

40
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,733
store and share your project. O what is

41
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,880
GitHub really? Let's just forget the

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,027
whole intimidating tech reputation for a

43
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:41,532
second. At its heart, it's basically just

44
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,758
cloud. Storage, but with a superpower and

45
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:45,856
that superpower is a time machine Every

46
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,254
time you save your work, it doesn't just

47
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,651
back it U, it creates a specific version

48
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,349
you can go back to at anytime It's like

49
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,447
the ultimate safety net for your entire

50
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:57,844
design process. OK, so now we know what

51
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:00,542
it is let's take that first big step we

52
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:02,340
are going to create your professional.

53
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,604
Home on the Internet your very first

54
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:07,100
GitHub repository and you are going to be

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,284
amazed at how simple this is. Seriously,

56
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:12,092
you just go to github.com & up. You know,

57
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:14,276
just like you would for any other

58
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:17,084
website. A little pro tip, try to pick a

59
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:18,332
professional sounding username because

60
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,516
you might end up sharing this with

61
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,700
clients one day. You verify your e-mail.

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,768
And, well, that's literally it. And

63
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,924
justice like that, you've done it. No,

64
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:29,388
really, take a second and let that sink

65
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:31,544
in. That thing that might have seemed

66
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,700
kind of complicated a few minutes ago,

67
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,164
you just did it. That feeling of progress

68
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,320
right there. We're going to keep building

69
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,784
on that. Now, when you create your first

70
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,632
project folder, they call it a

71
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:44,772
repository. You have a little choice to

72
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:47,002
make. You can have a single repo where

73
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,953
all your design specs and maybe some

74
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:50,905
future code live together, which by the

75
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,856
way, is perfect for beginners. Or you

76
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,528
could have separate repos for everything,

77
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:56,758
which is more of a big corporate thing

78
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,709
for this course. Trust me, we're going

79
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,660
with the single repo. It keeps everything

80
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,890
simple and all in one place. So once

81
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,563
you've named your repository and you

82
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:06,867
click that. The right button boom, that's

83
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,551
it. You are now officially a GitHub user.

84
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,900
You have a professional space to house

85
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,248
your work. Feels pretty good, right? OK,

86
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:16,597
now let's build the workshop where you'll

87
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,945
actually do the designing All right, we

88
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:21,629
have our cloud storage all set U Now

89
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:23,978
it's time to build your local workshop

90
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:26,050
we're going to install. Something called

91
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,020
an IDE, and I promise you it is not

92
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,1000
nearly as complicated as that acronym

93
00:03:30,1000 --> 00:03:33,970
sounds. O what on earth is an IDE? It's

94
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,280
just a fancy acronym for your digital

95
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,590
workspace. And here's the best way to

96
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,900
think about it. If Microsoft Word is

97
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,540
where you write documents and IDE is your

98
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,860
workspace for crafting design

99
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,904
specifications for WDS. We highly, highly

100
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:48,771
recommend an app called Cursor because

101
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,261
it's built for the kind of AI assisted

102
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:53,750
work we'll be doing, and installing it is

103
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,618
something you've done 1000 times before.

104
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,796
You just download it, click through the

105
00:03:57,796 --> 00:03:59,352
installer like any other application,

106
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,842
pick a light or dark theme, the important

107
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,332
choice, and then you sign in with that

108
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:06,199
brand new GitHub account you just

109
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,039
created. And that seamlessly connects

110
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,912
your local computer to your cloud

111
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:12,097
storage. OK, so inside your new IDE,

112
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,282
you're going to find something called a

113
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:16,468
terminal. And yet, for a lot of

114
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:18,653
designers, that little black box with the

115
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:20,526
blinking cursor looks pretty scary. It

116
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,336
feels like you need to be some kind of

117
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,521
coding genius just to touch it. But

118
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:28,061
here's the secret you. Do not need to

119
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,197
learn some new complex language for this

120
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:32,333
entire course. You are almost always just

121
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,774
going to be copying commands that we give

122
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,910
you and pasting them into the terminal.

123
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,351
That's it. It's just another way to talk

124
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:41,182
to your computer typing instead of

125
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,318
clicking. And now for the magic trick.

126
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:45,759
We've got our home in the cloud on

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,971
GitHub, and we've got our workshop. On

128
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,219
our computer, the next step is to connect

129
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:52,748
them. We're going to bring a copy of your

130
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:54,996
roject home. We do this with a process

131
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,963
called cloning, and all that really means

132
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,491
is making a local copy of your project on

133
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,177
your computer that stays perfectly In

134
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,425
Sync with what's on GitHub. You can think

135
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:05,673
of it exactly like Dropbox sync, but with

136
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,359
that super powerful version history that

137
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,471
time. Machine built right in and the

138
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:11,819
process is just so simple. You copy the

139
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:14,168
URL from your GitHub page, you open U

140
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:16,516
that terminal in your IDE and you just

141
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,864
type git clone and then paste the link.

142
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:21,506
But now check out Step 4. This is the

143
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,854
really cool part. If you don't happen to

144
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:26,202
have git installed yet, your IDE is smart

145
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,904
enough to see that it'll. Pop up and ask

146
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:31,501
if you want to install it, you click 1

147
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,521
button and it does everything for you.

148
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:36,407
And just like that get us set U OK? With

149
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,427
all the tools locked and loaded, we've

150
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:40,736
made it to the final and honestly the

151
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,756
most exciting part of this whole setup.

152
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,064
It's time to bring in the White Port

153
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:46,796
Design Studio methodology and meet your

154
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,268
personal AI guide, Mimir. First, you'll

155
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:51,571
create a special folder called Docs, and

156
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:54,533
what's so cool about this is it lays out

157
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,836
the entire WDC process for you. These

158
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,810
eight folders aren't just random names,

159
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,785
they are the complete battle tested

160
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,759
design methodology that's going to guide

161
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,720
you all the way from the first idea to

162
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,695
the final delivery. This folder becomes

163
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:10,110
the single source of truth. For your

164
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,558
entire project and now you meet your

165
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:15,007
guide. Mimir is the AI orchestrator for

166
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,806
WDS. And what this means is that from

167
00:06:17,806 --> 00:06:20,255
this moment forward, you are never alone.

168
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,703
Anytime you feel stuck, anytime you have

169
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:25,502
a question or you just need a little

170
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:27,951
direction, you just type at WD Schmear

171
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,715
right there in your IDE. And your guide

172
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:33,039
will be there to help you out. And with

173
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,846
that, you're done. The set is complete.

174
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:37,170
You are ready to go. But hey, before we

175
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,236
move on, let's just hit pause for a

176
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,044
second and look back at everything you

177
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:43,110
just did. No, seriously, take a moment. A

178
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,175
lot of designers get stuck at this stage

179
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,241
for a long time, but you just pushed

180
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,307
right through it. Do you realize what a

181
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:52,118
big deal that is?I mean, look

182
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:54,611
at this list. You created a GitHub

183
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,392
account and a professional repository,

184
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:58,529
you installed a professional grade IDE,

185
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:01,022
you actually used the command line to

186
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:03,159
clone your first project, you integrated

187
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,296
the entire WDS framework, and you

188
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:07,432
activated your personal AI guide. This

189
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:09,925
wasn't just about clicking a few buttons,

190
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:12,712
this was a transformation. You may have

191
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,837
started out feeling like a nervous

192
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:17,316
beginner, but right now you are a

193
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:19,795
designer who is equipped with a fully

194
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:21,566
professional industry standard set. O.

195
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,691
Let's end with this thought. After

196
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,461
everything you just accomplished, there

197
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:28,294
is no more. I might be able to

198
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:31,128
do this. You just proved to yourself that

199
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:33,836
you are able. The setup is done,

200
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:36,174
your environment is ready, and your guide

201
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,846
me mayor is waiting for you. Welcome to

202
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:39,180
WDS.
