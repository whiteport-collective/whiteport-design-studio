# Tutorial 04: Map Triggers & Outcomes

**Hands-on guide to understanding WHAT triggers user needs and WHY your business exists**

---

## Overview

This tutorial teaches you how to map the psychological triggers that drive user behavior and connect them to business outcomes.

**Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Module 03 completed (Target Groups identified)  
**What you'll create:** A complete trigger map for your top target group

---

## What You'll Learn

- How to identify user trigger moments
- Mapping from trigger → need → solution → outcome
- Connecting user psychology to business value
- Prioritizing features by trigger impact
- Creating a traceable chain of reasoning

---

## Step 1: Select Your Top Target Group (5 min)

From Module 03, choose your highest-priority target group.

**Example (Dog Week):**

```
Target Group: Busy Parents with Family Dog
Priority: #1 (highest impact + feasibility)
```

**Your turn:**

```
Selected Target Group: [Your top group]
Why this group: [Reasoning]
```

---

## Step 2: Identify Trigger Moments (15 min)

### What is a trigger?

A specific moment when a user realizes they have a need your product can solve.

### Framework: The Trigger Moment

**Ask:**

- WHEN does the user feel pain/frustration?
- WHAT specific situation causes this?
- WHY does this matter to them emotionally?

**Example (Dog Week - Busy Parents):**

**Trigger 1: Morning Chaos**

```
WHEN: Monday morning, everyone rushing
WHAT: Nobody knows who's walking the dog
WHY: Stress, guilt, family conflict, dog's needs unmet
```

**Trigger 2: Forgotten Feeding**

```
WHEN: Evening, parent realizes dog wasn't fed
WHAT: Uncertainty about who was responsible
WHY: Guilt, worry about dog's health, family tension
```

**Trigger 3: Vet Appointment Missed**

```
WHEN: Vet calls about missed appointment
WHAT: Nobody remembered or knew about it
WHY: Embarrassment, concern for dog, wasted money
```

**Your turn:**

```
Identify 3-5 trigger moments for your target group:

Trigger 1: [Name]
WHEN: [Specific moment]
WHAT: [Specific situation]
WHY: [Emotional impact]

Trigger 2: [Name]
WHEN:
WHAT:
WHY:

[Continue for 3-5 triggers]
```

**AI Support:**

```
Agent: "Let's dig deeper into each trigger:
- What happens right before this moment?
- What emotions does the user feel?
- How often does this happen?
- What do they try now (that doesn't work)?"
```

---

## Step 3: Map User Needs (10 min)

### What is the need?

The underlying requirement the user has when triggered.

### Framework: From Trigger to Need

**For each trigger, ask:**

- What does the user need in this moment?
- What would make this situation better?
- What's the core problem to solve?

**Example (Dog Week):**

**Trigger: Morning Chaos**

```
Need: Know immediately who's responsible for dog care today
Need: See the full week's schedule at a glance
Need: Get reminded before tasks are due
```

**Trigger: Forgotten Feeding**

```
Need: Track whether tasks were completed
Need: Get notifications when tasks are overdue
Need: See task history to avoid confusion
```

**Your turn:**

```
For each trigger, identify 2-3 core needs:

Trigger 1: [Name]
Needs:
- [Need 1]
- [Need 2]
- [Need 3]

[Continue for all triggers]
```

---

## Step 4: Define Solutions (10 min)

### What is the solution?

The specific feature or capability that addresses the need.

### Framework: Need to Solution

**For each need, ask:**

- What feature would solve this?
- How would it work?
- What's the simplest version?

**Example (Dog Week):**

**Need: Know who's responsible today**

```
Solution: Daily schedule view with assigned responsibilities
- Shows today's tasks
- Highlights current user's tasks
- Shows who's assigned to each task
```

**Need: Get reminded before tasks are due**

```
Solution: Smart notifications
- Reminder 1 hour before task
- Escalation if task not completed
- Family-wide visibility of overdue tasks
```

**Your turn:**

```
For each need, define a solution:

Need: [Need description]
Solution: [Feature name]
- [How it works]
- [Key capabilities]
- [User benefit]

[Continue for all needs]
```

**AI Support:**

```
Agent: "Let's validate each solution:
- Does this truly solve the need?
- Is it the simplest solution?
- Are there edge cases to consider?
- How does this connect to business goals?"
```

---

## Step 5: Map Business Outcomes (10 min)

### What is the outcome?

The business value created when users get their needs met.

### Framework: Solution to Outcome

**For each solution, ask:**

- How does this create business value?
- What metrics improve?
- How does this support business goals?

**Example (Dog Week):**

**Solution: Daily schedule view**

```
User Outcome: Reduced stress, better dog care
Business Outcome:
- Increased daily active users (checking schedule)
- Higher retention (solving real pain)
- Word-of-mouth growth (visible family benefit)
Metrics: DAU, retention rate, NPS
```

**Solution: Smart notifications**

```
User Outcome: Never miss dog care tasks
Business Outcome:
- Increased engagement (notification opens)
- Higher task completion (core value delivered)
- Premium feature potential (advanced notifications)
Metrics: Notification open rate, task completion rate, conversion
```

**Your turn:**

```
For each solution, map to business outcomes:

Solution: [Feature name]
User Outcome: [How user benefits]
Business Outcome: [How business benefits]
Metrics: [What you'll measure]

[Continue for all solutions]
```

## Step 6: Create Trigger Map Visualization (10 min)

### Format:

```
TARGET GROUP: [Group name]

TRIGGER → NEED → SOLUTION → OUTCOME

1. [Trigger name]
   WHEN: [Moment]
   ↓
   NEED: [Core need]
   ↓
   SOLUTION: [Feature]
   ↓
   OUTCOME: [Business value]
   METRICS: [Measurements]

2. [Next trigger...]
```

**Example (Dog Week - Simplified):**

```
TARGET GROUP: Busy Parents with Family Dog

TRIGGER → NEED → SOLUTION → OUTCOME

1. Morning Chaos
   WHEN: Monday morning, nobody knows dog responsibilities
   ↓
   NEED: Know who's responsible for dog care today
   ↓
   SOLUTION: Daily schedule view with assigned tasks
   ↓
   OUTCOME: Increased DAU, higher retention
   METRICS: Daily active users, 7-day retention

2. Forgotten Feeding
   WHEN: Evening, uncertainty about feeding
   ↓
   NEED: Track task completion in real-time
   ↓
   SOLUTION: Task completion tracking + notifications
   ↓
   OUTCOME: Higher engagement, core value delivered
   METRICS: Task completion rate, notification opens
```

**Your turn:**

```
Create your trigger map:
[Your complete map]
```

## Step 7: Prioritize by Impact (5 min)

### Framework: Impact Score

**For each trigger-to-outcome chain, rate:**

- **User Impact** (1-5): How much does this help the user?
- **Business Impact** (1-5): How much business value does this create?
- **Feasibility** (1-5): How easy is this to build?

**Calculate:** `Priority Score = (User Impact + Business Impact) × Feasibility`

**Example (Dog Week):**

```
1. Morning Chaos → Daily Schedule
   User: 5, Business: 5, Feasibility: 4
   Score: (5+5) × 4 = 40 ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY

2. Forgotten Feeding → Task Tracking
   User: 5, Business: 4, Feasibility: 4
   Score: (5+4) × 4 = 36 ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

3. Vet Appointment → Calendar Integration
   User: 4, Business: 3, Feasibility: 2
   Score: (4+3) × 2 = 14 → LOWER PRIORITY
```

**Your turn:**

```
Score and rank your triggers:
[Your prioritized list]
```

---

## Step 8: Save Your Trigger Map

**Create file:** `B-Trigger-Map/trigger-map-[target-group].md`

**Use template from:** `workflows/2-trigger-mapping/templates/trigger-map.template.md`

---

## What You've Accomplished

✅ **Identified trigger moments** - You know WHEN users need your product  
✅ **Mapped user needs** - You understand WHAT users need  
✅ **Defined solutions** - You know WHAT to build  
✅ **Connected to business** - You know WHY each feature matters  
✅ **Prioritized features** - You know WHAT to build first

## The Power of Trigger Mapping

**This is strategic gold:**

- Every feature traces back to a real user trigger
- Every decision is backed by user psychology
- Every feature connects to business value
- No more guessing what to build
- No more building things nobody uses

**When product managers ask "what should we build next?"**  
→ You have the answer, backed by data and reasoning

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**

- Repeat for your top 2-3 target groups
- Compare trigger maps across groups
- Identify overlapping needs (efficiency opportunity)

**Next Module:**

- [Module 05: Prioritize Features](../module-05-prioritize-features/module-05-overview.md)
- Create your feature roadmap based on trigger impact

---

## Common Questions

**Q: How many triggers should I identify per target group?**  
A: Start with 3-5 major triggers. You can always add more later.

**Q: What if multiple triggers lead to the same solution?**  
A: Perfect! This means the solution has high leverage. Document all triggers it solves.

**Q: Should I map triggers for all target groups?**  
A: Start with your top 1-2 groups. Add more as needed.

**Q: How do I validate these triggers are real?**  
A: User research, interviews, observation. The trigger map is a hypothesis to test.

## Tips for Success

**DO ✅**

- Be specific about trigger moments
- Focus on emotional impact (the "why")
- Connect everything to business outcomes
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Test assumptions with users

**DON'T ❌**

- List generic "user wants X" statements
- Skip the emotional "why"
- Create solutions without clear triggers
- Try to solve everything at once
- Forget to measure outcomes

---

**Your trigger map is the strategic foundation that guides every design decision!**
