# Module 04: Product Brief

## Lesson 6: Additional Strategic Documents

**Expanding your strategic foundation based on project needs**

---

## Beyond the Core Brief

The Product Brief is your foundation - the document every project needs. But some projects need additional strategic documents to provide deeper clarity in specific areas.

**The principle:** Start with the Product Brief. Add other documents only when your project actually needs them.

**All documents live together:**
```
/docs/A-Product-Brief/
  ├── project-brief.md (always)
  ├── core-features.md (if needed)
  ├── tone-of-voice.md (if needed)
  ├── visual-design-brief.md (if needed)
  └── [other strategic docs as needed]
```

**Why this matters:**
- Single folder for all strategic decisions
- Easy to reference and update
- Version controlled together
- Shared across entire team

---

## How to Decide What You Need

**Start with Product Brief (always)**

Then add documents based on these questions:

### Core Features Document

**Add if:**
- ✅ Product has 10+ features
- ✅ Team needs prioritization clarity
- ✅ Working with external developers
- ✅ Risk of scope creep

**Skip if:**
- ❌ Simple product (< 5 features)
- ❌ Solo developer
- ❌ Clear priorities already

### Tone of Voice Guide

**Add if:**
- ✅ Significant written content
- ✅ Multiple people writing copy
- ✅ Brand voice is critical
- ✅ Customer-facing communication

**Skip if:**
- ❌ Minimal text in product
- ❌ Single writer
- ❌ Internal tool only

### Visual Design Brief

**Add if:**
- ✅ Creating custom visual design
- ✅ Working with external designers
- ✅ Visual brand is critical
- ✅ Need alignment before design

**Skip if:**
- ❌ Using existing design system
- ❌ Solo designer with clear vision
- ❌ Visual design not critical

### Technical Architecture Brief

**Add if:**
- ✅ Complex technical requirements
- ✅ Working with external developers
- ✅ Multiple integration points

**The rule:** Don't create documents you won't use. Start minimal, add as needed.

## Keeping It Manageable

**Don't create everything at once:**

**Phase 1 (Always):**
- Product Brief

**Phase 2 (As needed for MVP):**
- Core Features (if complex)
- Technical Brief (if complex)

**Phase 3 (As project grows):**
- Tone of Voice (when writing matters)
- Visual Design Brief (when design starts)

**Phase 4 (As you scale):**
- Content Strategy (when content grows)
- Localization (when expanding markets)
- Accessibility (when compliance needed)
- Data & Privacy (when handling sensitive data)

**The principle:** Add documents when the pain of not having them exceeds the effort of creating them.
