# Lesson 1: Understanding Alignment

**Why alignment matters before starting work - and why understanding comes first**

**Time:** 10 minutes

## The Foundation: Understand Before You Solve

Before we talk about alignment documents and contracts, let's talk about the discipline that makes everything else work: **understanding before solving**.

**The carpenter measures twice before cutting once.**  
**The doctor diagnoses before writing a prescription.**  
**You understand deeply before proposing solutions.**

This isn't about being slow. It's about being professional.

## The Two-Meeting Approach

**Meeting 1: Discovery**
- Ask questions
- Find the real pain points
- Take notes
- Confirm understanding
- Say: "Let me think about this and come back with a thoughtful proposal"
- **Do NOT present solutions yet**

**Meeting 2: Presentation**
- Present your thoughtful alignment document
- Show you understand their needs
- Negotiate and iterate
- Get acceptance

**Why this matters:** When you resist the urge to solve immediately and take time to understand deeply, stakeholders FEEL that you genuinely care about their success, not just about showing off your cleverness.

## Why Alignment Matters

When you're building something that makes the world a better place, and you need others involved, you need alignment first.

**Without alignment:**
- Misunderstandings about scope
- Disagreements about budget
- Unclear expectations
- Projects fail or stall

**With alignment:**
- Everyone understands the idea, why, what, how, budget, and commitment
- Clear expectations from the start
- Projects succeed because everyone is on the same page

## The 6 Elements of Alignment

When others are involved, you need alignment on:

1. **The Idea** - What are we building?
2. **Why** - Why should it be done?
3. **What** - What does it contain?
4. **How** - How will it be executed?
5. **Budget** - What resources are needed?
6. **Commitment** - What are we willing to commit to make it happen?

**But here's the key:** These elements come from discovery. You learn what they need FIRST, then you articulate these elements based on that understanding. You're not making this up - you're reflecting back what they told you matters to them.

## Discovery Questions That Reveal What They Need

Before you can create an alignment document, you need to understand what success looks like for THEM:

**Understanding Their Desired Outcomes:**
- **What does success look like for you?** (Their desired outcome)
- **What's not working right now?** (The pain they're experiencing)
- **Tell me more about that - what specifically happens?** (Dig deeper)
- **How does that impact your business/team/users?** (Understanding consequences)
- **What happens if we don't solve this?** (The cost of inaction)
- **What have you tried before?** (What didn't work and why)
- **What would make this a home run?** (Their definition of exceptional)

**Understanding Their Concerns & Risks:**
- **Is there something specific you're concerned about?** (Their worries)
- **What would help you feel confident about moving forward?** (What they need to feel secure)
- **What lessons have you learned from past projects?** (Learning from history without dwelling on failures)
- **What would make you feel this is going well as we proceed?** (Positive indicators)
- **What dependencies or external factors should we plan for?** (External factors, neutral framing)
- **What would be important to include in our agreement?** (Their priorities for protection)
- **How would you like us to handle changes or unexpected situations?** (Proactive planning)

**Keep asking until you find the real pain point AND the real risks.** Then enquire deeper about both. Confirm they actually exist before you even think about solutions.

**Why ask about risks?** Because understanding their concerns helps you:
- Create contract provisions that actually protect against real risks
- Set realistic expectations
- Build trust by showing you're thinking about problems, not just opportunities
- Design solutions that mitigate their specific concerns
- Include mutually beneficial protections in the agreement

## The Alignment Process

**The complete workflow from first meeting to project start:**

1. **Discovery meeting** - Listen: Ask questions, find pain points, take notes, confirm understanding
2. **Stop & reflect** - "Let me think about this and come back with a thoughtful proposal"
3. **Create alignment document** - Based on what you learned in discovery
4. **Presentation meeting** - Present: Share with stakeholders, show you understood them
5. **Iterate** - Negotiate: Adjust and refine together until you find the perfect match
6. **Get acceptance** - Accept: They say "Yes, this is exactly what we need"
7. **Generate signoff document** - Contract: Create short, clear contract based on accepted pitch
8. **Sign** - Both parties sign
9. **Create project brief** - Brief: Use pitch and contract as the backbone

**Key principle:** The pitch and contract aren't throwaway documents. They become the foundation that guides your entire project. Everything connects.

## Key Takeaways

**The discipline of professional patience:**
- The carpenter measures twice before cutting once
- The doctor diagnoses before prescribing
- You understand before solving

**The mindset shift:**
- When you genuinely understand what they need, pitching stops feeling like selling and starts feeling like helping
- You're not trying to impress them with quick solutions - you're serving them with thoughtful understanding

**WDS helps with alignment** - getting everyone on the same page before starting work. But it starts with the discipline to understand deeply first. The alignment phase is collaborative and iterative. Once approved, the signoff document formalizes that commitment.
