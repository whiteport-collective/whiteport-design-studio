# Lesson 2: Creating Your Alignment Document

**The 10 sections that ensure everyone understands and agrees - AFTER you've done discovery**

**Time:** 20 minutes

---

## Before You Create: The Discovery Phase

**You are NOT ready to create an alignment document until you've completed discovery.**

Remember:
- **The carpenter measures twice** before cutting once
- **The doctor diagnoses** before writing a prescription  
- **You understand deeply** before creating your pitch

**Have you:**
- ✅ Had a discovery conversation with your stakeholder?
- ✅ Asked questions until you found the real pain point?
- ✅ Confirmed that pain point actually exists?
- ✅ Taken notes on what success looks like for THEM?
- ✅ Said "Let me think about this and come back"?

**If NO to any of these:** Go back and complete discovery first. Don't guess what they need.

**If YES:** Now you're ready to create a compelling alignment document based on real understanding.

## What is an Alignment Document?

An alignment document (also called a "pitch") is a clear, brief document that:
- Reflects back what you learned in discovery
- Makes the case for why the project matters (in their words)
- Presents your solution based on understanding their needs
- Gets stakeholder buy-in before starting detailed work
- Can be read in 2-3 minutes
- Allows for negotiation and iteration

**Key principle:** You're not making this up or guessing. You're synthesizing what they told you they need into a clear, compelling document.

## The 10 Sections

Work through these sections **in whatever order makes sense** for your thinking:

### 1. The Realization
**What we've realized needs attention**
- What observation have you made?
- What challenge are you seeing?
- What evidence supports this realization?

### 2. Why It Matters
**Why this matters and who we help**
- Why does this matter?
- Who are we helping?
- What are their pain points?
- What impact will this have?
- How does this add value to specific people?

### 3. How We See It Working
**Brief overview of the solution approach**
- How do you envision this working?
- What's the general approach?
- How does it address the realization?
- What's the core concept?

### 4. Paths We Explored
**2-3 solution options we considered**
- What alternatives did you consider?
- Why did you explore these paths?
- What are the trade-offs?

### 5. Recommended Solution
**Preferred approach and why**
- Which solution do you recommend?
- Why this solution over others?
- What makes it the best choice?

### 6. The Path Forward
**How the work will be done**
- Which WDS phases are included?
- What's the practical approach?
- How will the work be executed?

### 7. The Value We'll Create
**What happens if we DO build this**

**Frame as positive assumption with success metrics:**
- **Our Ambition**: What we're confidently striving to accomplish (enthusiastic, positive)
- **Success Metrics**: How we'll measure success (specific, measurable)
- **What Success Looks Like**: Clear outcomes (tangible results)
- **Monitoring Approach**: How we'll track these metrics (brief)

**Key principle**: "We're confident this will work, and here's how we'll measure our success"

### 8. Cost of Inaction
**What happens if we DON'T build this**
- What are the consequences of not acting?
- What opportunities are lost?
- What problems continue or worsen?

### 9. Our Commitment
**Resources needed and potential risks**
- What's the budget?
- How much time is needed?
- What team/resources are required?
- What potential risks or challenges should we consider?

### 10. Summary
**Summary of key points**
- Recap the key points
- Let readers draw their own conclusion

## Best Practices: Identifying and Confirming the Realization

**The foundation of a compelling alignment document** is a well-articulated realization that stakeholders recognize and agree needs attention.

### Step 1: Identify the Realization or Challenge

**Start by clearly articulating:**
- What have you realized needs attention?
- What observation or challenge are you seeing?
- What opportunity is being missed?

**Be specific** - Vague realizations lead to vague solutions. Instead of "users are frustrated," say "we've realized that users abandon the checkout process 40% of the time because it requires 12 form fields."

### Step 2: Confirm It's Real

**Don't assume** - Verify that this realization is grounded in reality:
- Ask stakeholders directly
- Observe behavior
- Review existing data
- Check if others have noticed this too

**A real realization has:**
- Clear evidence supporting it
- Measurable indicators
- Stakeholders who recognize it
- Impact that matters

### Step 3: Present Evidence

**Evidence makes your realization credible.** Use both soft and hard evidence:

#### Soft Evidence (Indications, Testimonials, Complaints)

**What it is:** Qualitative indicators that support the realization

**Examples:**
- **Testimonials**: "Our customers tell us they struggle with..."
- **Complaints**: "Support tickets show users complaining about..."
- **Indications**: "We've noticed that users often..."
- **Anecdotes**: "In our user interviews, three people mentioned..."
- **Observations**: "When we watch users, they consistently..."

**How to use it:**
- Quote specific feedback or complaints
- Reference user interviews or conversations
- Mention patterns you've observed
- Include stakeholder concerns you've heard

**Example:**
> "Our customer support team reports that 60% of support tickets are about users unable to find the settings menu. One customer wrote: 'I've been using this for 6 months and still can't figure out where the settings are.'"

#### Hard Evidence (Statistics, Log Analysis, Survey Tests)

**What it is:** Quantitative data that supports the realization

**Examples:**
- **Statistics**: "40% of users drop off at checkout"
- **Log analysis**: "Server logs show 500 errors occur 3x per day"
- **Survey results**: "85% of survey respondents rated this feature as 'difficult to use'"
- **Analytics**: "Bounce rate increased 25% after the redesign"
- **A/B test results**: "Version A had 30% higher completion rate"
- **Performance metrics**: "Page load time averages 8 seconds"

**How to use it:**
- Include specific numbers and percentages
- Reference time periods ("in the last quarter")
- Compare to benchmarks or previous performance
- Show trends over time

**Example:**
> "Analytics show that 45% of users abandon the checkout process, with an average of 8 minutes spent before leaving. This represents a 20% increase from last quarter. Server logs indicate that 15% of these abandonments occur during payment processing, suggesting technical issues."

### Combining Soft and Hard Evidence

**Best practice:** Use both types together for maximum impact:

**Example:**
> "Our customers consistently report frustration with the checkout process (soft evidence: testimonials). Analytics confirm this: 45% abandon checkout, and those who complete it take an average of 12 minutes - 3x longer than industry standard (hard evidence: statistics). Support tickets show 60% of complaints are about checkout complexity (soft evidence: complaints), and our recent survey found 78% of users rated checkout as 'difficult' (hard evidence: survey)."

### Why Evidence Matters

**Without evidence:**
- Stakeholders may not believe the realization is real
- You might address the wrong thing
- Budget approval is harder to get
- The case for action is weak

**With evidence:**
- Stakeholders recognize the realization
- The urgency is clear
- Budget approval is easier
- The case for action is compelling

### Where to Find Evidence

**Look for evidence in:**
- Customer support tickets and feedback
- User interviews and surveys
- Analytics and usage data
- Server logs and error reports
- Sales conversations and objections
- Competitive analysis
- Industry reports and benchmarks
- Internal team observations

**If you don't have evidence yet:**
- Acknowledge this in your alignment document
- Propose gathering evidence as part of the project
- Use stakeholder conversations as initial evidence
- Reference similar realizations in the industry

## Flexible Exploration

**You can start anywhere:**
- Start with something you've realized needs attention (from discovery)
- Start with a solution you have in mind (based on understanding their needs)
- Start with why it matters (using what they told you)

**Saga will guide you** through all sections in whatever order makes sense for your thinking. But everything should be grounded in what you learned during discovery.

**If you realize you don't actually know something:** Don't guess. That's a signal you need to go back and ask more discovery questions. Saga will help you identify what's missing.

---

## Extracting Information (Optional)

**If you have existing communications or documents:**
- Share emails, chats, or documents with stakeholders
- Share notes from your discovery meeting
- Saga will extract key information:
  - Realizations or observations mentioned
  - Requirements discussed
  - Concerns raised
  - What success looks like for them
  - Context and background
  - Timeline or urgency
  - Budget or constraints

**This helps inform** your alignment document sections with real evidence from your conversations.

---

## Synthesizing the Document

**After exploring all sections:**
- Saga will help you synthesize into a clear, compelling document
- Review together: "Does this capture your idea?"
- Make adjustments until it's right
- Create: `docs/1-project-brief/pitch.md`

---

## Key Principles

- **Discovery first** - Understand before you create the document
- **Collaborative** - You and Saga build it together
- **Grounded in their needs** - Based on what they told you matters
- **Iterative** - You can refine and improve
- **Clear** - Readable in 2-3 minutes
- **Compelling** - Makes the case for the project using their language

**Remember:** When you genuinely understand what they need and can clearly specify their desired outcomes, writing the pitch becomes 10x easier. You're not guessing or convincing - you're articulating back to them what they said they need with a clear path forward.
