# Lesson 3: Negotiation & Acceptance

**Getting everyone on the same page**

**Time:** 10 minutes

## The Negotiation Phase

**After creating your alignment document:**
- Share it with stakeholders
- Gather their feedback
- Make changes and iterate
- Update until everyone is on board

**This phase is collaborative** - negotiation and iteration are welcome and expected.

---

## Sharing with Stakeholders

**Present your alignment document:**
- Share `docs/1-project-brief/pitch.md`
- Explain that this is a draft for discussion
- Invite feedback and questions
- Be open to changes

**Different ways to share:**
- Email the document
- Present in a meeting
- Share via collaboration tool
- Walk through it together

---

## Gathering Feedback

**Listen for:**
- Concerns or questions
- Requests for clarification
- Suggestions for changes
- Different perspectives
- Budget or timeline concerns

**Document feedback:**
- Note what stakeholders are saying
- Understand their concerns
- Identify what needs to change

---

## Iterating the Document

**Make changes based on feedback:**
- Update sections that need clarification
- Address concerns raised
- Incorporate suggestions
- Refine until everyone is satisfied

**Saga can help you:**
- Update the alignment document
- Refine sections based on feedback
- Ensure clarity and completeness

## Getting Acceptance

**Once everyone agrees:**
- ✅ Everyone understands the idea
- ✅ Everyone agrees on why, what, how
- ✅ Budget is understood and accepted
- ✅ Commitment is clear
- ✅ **You have alignment**

**This is the goal** - getting everyone on the same page before starting work.

## When Acceptance Happens

**Acceptance might come:**
- After one round of feedback
- After multiple iterations

**Variable time** - could be hours or days. The alignment document helps speed this up.
