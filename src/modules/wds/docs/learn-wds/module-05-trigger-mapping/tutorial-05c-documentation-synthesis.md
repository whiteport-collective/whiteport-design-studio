# Tutorial 05C: Synthesize from Documentation

**Transform existing research into an actionable Trigger Map**

---

## Overview

This tutorial walks you through synthesizing your existing documentation into a complete Trigger Map with Saga the Analyst. Instead of starting from scratch, you'll validate and organize what you already have, filling gaps through focused conversation.

**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Existing documentation (vision docs, user research, plans, or interviews)  
**What you'll create:** Synthesized Trigger Map + gap analysis

---

## When to Use This Approach

**Documentation Synthesis is ideal for:**
- ✅ You have extensive vision/strategy documents
- ✅ User research or interview transcripts exist
- ✅ Project plans or roadmaps already created
- ✅ Need to make existing documentation actionable
- ✅ Documentation is too long for anyone to read

**Use Full Trigger Mapping instead if:**
- ❌ Starting from scratch with no documentation
- ❌ Documentation is minimal or non-existent

**Use Value Trigger Chain instead if:**
- ❌ Need quick validation (under 20 minutes)
- ❌ Single user journey focus

**Not sure which to use?** See [Lesson 2: Heritage & Evolution](lesson-02-heritage-evolution.md#three-approaches-choose-your-path)

---

## The Problem This Solves

**Common scenario:**
- Organization spends thousands on research
- 200-page reports nobody reads
- Interview transcripts gathering dust
- Vision documents lost in shared drives
- Designers paste 100+ pages into AI chats (hitting token limits)

**The solution:**
Transform that investment into a **single-slide strategic artifact** you can actually use in daily design work and AI conversations.

---

## Before You Start

### What You Need

**Documentation (any combination of):**
- Vision or strategy documents
- User research reports
- Interview transcripts
- Target group analysis
- Project plans or roadmaps
- Feature specifications
- Market research

**Also need:**
- ✅ WDS installed and Saga activated
- ✅ 30-45 minutes of focused time
- ✅ Ability to share documentation (paste, upload, or describe)

### What to Expect

**Saga will:**
- Analyze your documentation
- Frame questions based on what your material suggests
- Validate findings with you
- Fill gaps through conversation
- Identify documentation strengths and weaknesses
- Create your Trigger Map

**You will:**
- Share your documentation
- Validate what Saga extracts
- Fill gaps where documentation is incomplete
- Make prioritization decisions
- Confirm strategic alignment

**Important:** Documentation may only answer **part** of the Trigger Map questions. That's normal. Saga will frame questions as "Your material suggests X, is this correct?" and fill gaps collaboratively.

## Workshop Flow

### Starting the Workshop

**In your IDE, activate Saga:**

```
@saga I have existing documentation I want to synthesize into a Trigger Map. I have [describe what you have: vision docs, user research, plans, etc.].
```

**Then share your documentation:**
- Paste content directly into chat
- Upload files
- Provide links to documents
- Describe what's available

---

## Workshop 1: Business Goals (5-10 minutes)

### What Saga Will Do

**Analyze your documentation for:**
- Vision statements (explicit or implied)
- Strategic objectives (SMART or vague)
- Business goals and success criteria

### Three Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Clear vision and objectives found**
```
Saga: "Your documentation suggests this vision:
'Be the most trusted platform for dog owners in Sweden'

Is this accurate?"
```

**Scenario 2: Vague or implied vision**
```
Saga: "I found aspirational language in your docs. 
It seems like your vision is: [interpreted vision]
But this isn't explicitly stated. Is this accurate?"
```

**Scenario 3: No vision found (reverse engineering)**
```
Saga: "I don't see an explicit vision statement. 
However, based on your objectives and plans, 
the implied vision seems to be: [inferred vision]

This is reverse-engineered from what you're trying to achieve. 
Does this capture your aspirational goal?"
```

### Your Task

**Validate or refine:**
- Does the extracted vision capture your aspirational goal?
- Are the objectives truly SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)?
- Do objectives connect to the vision?

**Fill gaps:**
- If vision is missing, define it
- If objectives are vague, sharpen them using SMART method

---

## Workshop 2: Target Groups (5-10 minutes)

### What Saga Will Do

**Analyze your documentation for:**
- User segments or personas
- Behavioral descriptions
- User contexts and situations
- Demographics (but will push for psychology)
- User quotes or interview insights

### Three Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Target groups found**
```
Saga: "Your documentation identifies these user groups:
1. Dog Trainers - Professional trainers with 1000+ followers
2. Dog Owners - First-time owners seeking guidance
3. Veterinarians - Professionals recommending resources

I found 3 groups total. Should we focus on the top 3-4 most critical for your objectives?"
```

**Scenario 2: Demographics only (needs behavioral depth)**
```
Saga: "Your documentation mentions:
- Women aged 25-40
- Urban professionals
- Pet owners

However, these are demographic descriptions. 
For Trigger Mapping, we need behavioral profiles.

For each group, what's their context and situation when using your product?"
```

**Scenario 3: No clear target groups**
```
Saga: "I don't see clear target group definitions. 
Based on the context, these groups might be relevant:
- [Inferred group 1]: [reasoning]
- [Inferred group 2]: [reasoning]

Who are the 3-4 key user groups whose product usage will drive your objectives?"
```

### Your Task

**Validate or refine:**
- Are these the right target groups?
- Do descriptions capture behavioral context (not just demographics)?
- Is there psychological depth (goals, frustrations, context)?

**Fill gaps:**
- Transform demographics into behavioral profiles
- Add context and situation
- Include user quotes from research if available

---

## Workshop 3: Driving Forces (5-10 minutes)

### What Saga Will Do

**For each persona, analyze documentation for:**
- Positive drivers (wants, desires, aspirations)
- Negative drivers (fears, frustrations, anxieties)
- Pain points and desired outcomes

### Common Pattern: Missing Negative Drivers

**Most documentation focuses on positive wants:**
```
Saga: "Your documentation suggests Dog Trainers want to:
- Build their professional reputation
- Share training techniques
- Connect with potential clients

But I don't see explicit fears or frustrations.

Let's think about the flip side: What do they fear or want to avoid?
- Fear of looking unprofessional?
- Fear of wasting time on ineffective platforms?
- Frustration with current solutions?"
```

### Your Task

**Validate or refine:**
- Do positive drivers capture what users want to achieve?
- Are negative drivers identified? (Often missing in docs)
- Are drivers specific to usage context (not general life goals)?

**Fill gaps:**
- Transform pain points into psychological drivers
- Identify fears and frustrations (loss aversion is powerful!)
- Make drivers specific to product usage context

**Remember:** Negative drivers are often MORE powerful than positive ones.

---

## Workshop 4: Prioritization (5-10 minutes)

### What Saga Will Do

**Check documentation for priority signals:**
- Explicit priority statements
- Resource allocation (budget, team focus)
- Timeline emphasis (what's first)
- Frequency of mention
- Depth of research on certain groups

**Then prioritize through conversation:**
```
Saga: "For each group, let's assess:

Impact on objectives: If this group succeeds with your product, 
how much does it drive your objectives? (High/Medium/Low)

Feasibility: How easy is it to reach and serve this group? 
(High/Medium/Low)

Let's start with Dog Trainers:
- Impact on objectives?
- Feasibility?"
```

### Your Task

**Assess each group:**
- Impact on objectives (High/Medium/Low)
- Feasibility to reach and serve (High/Medium/Low)

**Validate prioritization:**
- Does the ranking align with your strategic thinking?
- Are top drivers the most critical to address?
- Does the focus statement capture where design efforts should go?

---

## Gap Analysis & Validation (5-10 minutes)

### What Saga Will Do

**Identify documentation strengths:**
```
✅ Clear vision statement
✅ Deep user research with interview quotes
✅ Behavioral personas with psychological depth
```

**Identify gaps:**
```
⚠️ Objectives are vague (not fully SMART)
   - Impact: Hard to measure success
   - What we did: Sharpened through conversation

⚠️ Negative drivers not explicitly mentioned
   - Impact: Missing powerful motivators
   - What we did: Inferred from pain points and validated
```

**Validate strategic alignment:**
```
Saga: "Your documentation says you want:
'Be the most trusted platform for dog owners'

Your plan/features suggest:
'Focus on professional trainers and monetization'

⚠️ Potential misalignment detected:
- Documentation emphasizes trust and all dog owners
- Plan focuses on professional segment and revenue
- Recommendation: Clarify if vision should be narrowed or plan broadened
```

### Your Task

**Review gaps:**
- Accept gaps and note for future research?
- Fill critical gaps now through focused conversation?

**Validate alignment:**
- Does your plan support your vision?
- Are there contradictions between docs and plans?
- Should anything be adjusted?

---

## What You'll Receive

### Trigger Map Documentation

**Same comprehensive output as full Trigger Mapping:**
- Vision statement
- Strategic objectives (SMART)
- Prioritized target groups with personas
- Driving forces (positive and negative)
- Mermaid diagram visualization
- Strategic focus statement

**Plus additional synthesis artifacts:**
- Gap analysis (what's strong vs. weak in documentation)
- Alignment check (does plan match vision?)
- Recommendations for future research

### How to Use Your Trigger Map

**Daily design work:**
- Reference it when making design decisions
- Validate features against prioritized drivers
- Keep team aligned on strategic priorities

**AI conversations:**
- Share single-slide Trigger Map instead of 200-page reports
- Provide strategic context without hitting token limits
- Much more useful than pasting extensive documentation

**Team alignment:**
- Single source of truth for strategy
- Clear priorities everyone understands
- Defensible design decisions

**Future research:**
- Gap analysis guides what to research next
- Identifies assumptions to validate
- Prevents redundant research

## Tips for Success

### Prepare Your Documentation

**Before starting:**
- Gather all relevant documents
- Know what you have (vision, research, plans, etc.)
- Be ready to share (paste, upload, or describe)

**Don't worry if:**
- Documentation is incomplete (normal!)
- Some sections are vague (we'll sharpen them)
- Negative drivers aren't mentioned (we'll add them)
- Prioritization isn't explicit (we'll determine it)

### During the Workshop

**Be honest about gaps:**
- "I don't know" is a valid answer
- Gaps help identify future research needs
- Better to acknowledge than guess

**Validate actively:**
- Don't just accept what Saga extracts
- Correct misinterpretations
- Refine vague statements

**Think psychologically:**
- Move beyond demographics to behavior
- Consider both positive and negative drivers
- Focus on usage context, not general life goals

### After the Workshop

**Use your Trigger Map:**
- Reference it in design decisions
- Share it in AI chats for context
- Keep it updated as strategy evolves

**Address gaps:**
- Plan research to fill critical gaps
- Validate assumptions with users
- Update Trigger Map as you learn

## Common Questions

**Q: What if my documentation is really extensive (100+ pages)?**
A: Perfect use case! Saga will extract the strategic elements and create a single-slide reference. Much more useful than reading hundreds of pages.

**Q: What if documentation contradicts itself?**
A: Saga will identify contradictions during alignment check. You'll discuss and resolve them.

**Q: What if I only have partial documentation (e.g., just user research, no vision)?**
A: No problem. Saga will extract what's there and fill gaps through conversation. You'll end up with a complete Trigger Map.

**Q: Can I update the Trigger Map later if documentation changes?**
A: Yes! You can re-run synthesis or update specific sections as your strategy evolves.

**Q: How is this different from just reading my documentation?**
A: Trigger Map organizes research into actionable structure, identifies gaps, validates alignment, and creates a single-slide reference you can actually use daily.
