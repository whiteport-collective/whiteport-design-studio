# Lesson 7: Workshop 5 - Feature Impact

**Score Features by Strategic Impact**

---

## Overview

Workshop 5 is where strategy becomes actionable roadmap. You'll systematically score your feature ideas against the prioritized psychological drivers from Workshop 4, creating a data-driven feature prioritization.

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Format:** Conversational with Saga  
**Output:** Scored and ranked feature list

---

## What You'll Do

### 1. List Features

**Brainstorm all potential features:**
- Ideas from Product Brief
- Stakeholder requests
- Competitive features
- User feedback
- Team suggestions

**Aim for:** 10-20 features to evaluate

### 2. Score Each Feature

**Rate against top 5-7 prioritized drivers:**
- How well does this feature address each driver?
- Use 0-3 scale for each driver
- Be honest (don't inflate scores)

**Scoring scale:**
- **3** = Directly addresses this driver (core solution)
- **2** = Significantly helps with this driver
- **1** = Somewhat related to this driver
- **0** = Doesn't address this driver

### 3. Calculate Total Scores

**Sum scores across all drivers:**
- Add up the scores for each feature
- Higher total = higher strategic impact
- This becomes your prioritization data

### 4. Rank and Create Roadmap

**Sort features by total score:**
- Highest scores = Phase 1 (highest impact)
- High scores = Phase 2
- Medium scores = Phase 3
- Low scores = Backlog or cut

## Key Questions Saga Asks

### Listing Features

- "What features are you considering for this product?"
- "What ideas came up in your Product Brief?"
- "What have stakeholders requested?"
- "What do competitors offer that you're considering?"
- "Are there any features you're unsure about?"

### Scoring Each Feature

- "How well does [feature] address [top driver]?"
- "Does this feature create gain or reduce pain for this persona?"
- "On a scale of 0-3, how much impact does this have on [driver]?"
- "Why that score? What specifically does it address?"
- "Is this a 2 or a 3? What's the difference?"

### Validation

- "Are there features that would score higher that we haven't listed?"
- "Could we modify any features to increase their impact?"
- "Do these scores match your intuition? If not, why?"
- "Which features are you surprised scored high or low?"

## Generic Example: Scoring Matrix

### Context

**Top 5 Prioritized Drivers (Remote Team Leads):**
1. Fear of team burnout without noticing (NEGATIVE)
2. Want to demonstrate effective leadership (POSITIVE)
3. Fear of losing top performers (NEGATIVE)
4. Want to build strong team culture (POSITIVE)
5. Fear of missed deadlines (NEGATIVE)

### Features to Score

| Feature | Burnout Fear | Leadership | Retention | Culture | Deadlines | **Total** |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Daily team pulse check | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | **9** |
| Team workload dashboard | 3 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 2 | **9** |
| Recognition system | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | **7** |
| 1-on-1 scheduling assistant | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | **6** |
| Meeting summaries | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | **4** |
| Async video updates | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | **4** |
| Team chat | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | **3** |

### Detailed Scoring Example

**Total: 3 points** (Low strategic impact for this persona)

---

## Prioritized Roadmap

Based on scores, create phases:

### Phase 1: Highest Impact (8-10 points)
- Daily team pulse check (9)
- Team workload dashboard (9)

**Why first:** Directly address top fears, highest strategic value

### Phase 2: High Impact (6-7 points)
- Recognition system (7)
- 1-on-1 scheduling assistant (6)

**Why second:** Good strategic value, support top priorities

### Phase 3: Medium Impact (4-5 points)
- Meeting summaries (4)
- Async video updates (4)

**Why third:** Some value but lower priority

### Backlog: Low Impact (0-3 points)
- Team chat (3)

**Why backlog:** Doesn't address top strategic drivers for this persona

---

## Why This Works

### It's Strategic

**Every score connects to:**
- A prioritized psychological driver
- A prioritized target group
- A business goal

**Not arbitrary** - traceable to strategy

### It's Objective

**Traditional approach:**
"I think Feature A is more important"

**Feature Impact approach:**
"Feature A scores 9, Feature B scores 4"

**Data beats opinions**

### It's Defensible

**When stakeholders ask "Why aren't we building X?"**

**You can show:**
1. Here's our Trigger Map
2. Here are our top prioritized drivers
3. Here's how features score against them
4. Feature X scores lower than our current roadmap

**Strategic reasoning, not politics**

### It's Flexible

**When priorities change:**
- Update driver rankings
- Re-score features
- New roadmap emerges automatically

**Strategy drives features, not the reverse**

---

## Scoring Guidelines

### Be Honest

**Don't:**
- Inflate scores to justify pet features
- Score based on what you want to build
- Let politics influence scoring

**Do:**
- Score based on actual impact
- Accept that some features score low
- Challenge your own assumptions

### Be Specific

**When scoring, ask:**
- "How SPECIFICALLY does this address the driver?"
- "What about this feature reduces that pain?"
- "What evidence supports this score?"

### Use the Full Scale

**0-3 scale exists for a reason:**
- **0** is okay - not everything addresses everything
- **3** should be rare - only direct solutions
- **1-2** is where most scores land

### Consider Both Positive and Negative

**Features can address:**
- Negative drivers (reduce pain, prevent fears)
- Positive drivers (enable goals, create gains)
- Both (most powerful features)

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: High Scores Across Multiple Drivers

**What it means:** High-leverage feature addressing multiple needs

**Example:** Daily pulse check scores high on burnout fear, leadership goals, retention fear

**Action:** Prioritize - strategically valuable

### Pattern 2: High Score on Top Driver Only

**What it means:** Laser-focused solution for most important need

**Example:** Workload balancing scores 3 on burnout fear, low on others

**Action:** Still high priority if that driver is #1

### Pattern 3: Moderate Scores Across Many

**What it means:** Nice-to-have that helps a bit with everything

**Example:** Team chat scores 1-2 on multiple drivers

**Action:** Lower priority - not solving urgent problems

### Pattern 4: Low Scores Everywhere

**What it means:** Feature doesn't connect to strategy

**Example:** Fancy animations score 0-1 across all drivers

**Action:** Cut it or deprioritize significantly

---

## Beyond the Numbers

### The Conversation Matters

**Questions that emerge:**
- "Why doesn't this feature score higher?"
- "Could we modify it to address more drivers?"
- "Are we missing a feature that would score higher?"
- "Do these scores match our intuition?"

**Insights from discussion:**
- Features can be refined to increase impact
- Missing features can be identified
- Assumptions can be challenged
- Strategy can be sharpened

### Combining with Other Factors

**Feature Impact = Strategic value**

**Also consider:**
- **Feasibility:** How hard to build?
- **Dependencies:** What's required first?
- **Market timing:** Competitive urgency?
- **Resources:** Do we have capacity?

**Combined formula:**
```
Priority = (Strategic Impact × Feasibility) + Urgency Bonus
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Inflating Scores

**Problem:** Scoring pet features higher than deserved  
**Why it fails:** Undermines the whole system  
**Fix:** Be brutally honest, challenge yourself

### Mistake 2: Scoring Too Many Features

**Problem:** Trying to score 50+ features  
**Why it fails:** Takes too long, loses focus  
**Fix:** Start with 10-20 most viable features

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Low Scores

**Problem:** "But we still need to build it"  
**Why it fails:** Wastes resources on low-impact features  
**Fix:** Accept that some features should be cut

### Mistake 4: Not Re-Scoring

**Problem:** Never updating scores as you learn  
**Why it fails:** Roadmap becomes stale  
**Fix:** Re-score quarterly or when strategy shifts

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Feasibility

**Problem:** Prioritizing impossible features  
**Why it fails:** Can't actually execute  
**Fix:** Combine strategic score with feasibility

## Using the Scored Feature List

### For Sprint Planning

**Each sprint:**
- Reference the scored list
- Focus on highest-impact features
- Validate against Trigger Map
- Make trade-offs based on strategy

### For Stakeholder Communication

**When presenting:**
1. Show the Trigger Map
2. Show the scoring matrix
3. Show the prioritized list
4. Explain the strategic reasoning

**Stakeholders appreciate:**
- Clear methodology
- Traceable decisions
- Strategic foundation
- Data-driven approach

### For Design Decisions

**During design:**
- Reference the scores
- Focus on high-impact features first
- Ensure design addresses the drivers
