# Lesson 3: Workshop 1 - Business Goals

**Define What Winning Looks Like**

---

## Overview

Workshop 1 is where you establish the strategic foundation for your entire Trigger Map. You'll define both your aspirational vision and concrete measurable objectives that prove you're succeeding.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Format:** Conversational with Saga  
**Output:** Vision statement + 3-5 strategic objectives

---

## Understanding the Two Levels

Business goals work on two distinct levels:

### 1. Vision (Visionary Statements)

**What it is:**
- Aspirational and motivational
- Grand ambitions that reflect focus and direction
- Not exact or measurable
- Examples: "Be the best," "Fastest in market," "Top of mind"

**Characteristics:**
- Easy to set, hard to measure
- Provides the "why" and emotional drive
- Inspires and motivates the team
- Gives direction without rigid constraints

### 2. Strategic Objectives

**What it is:**
- Specific and measurable (expressed using SMART method)
- Observable evidence that vision is being realized
- Concrete milestones you can track
- Examples: "10,000 users by Q4," "70% retention rate"

**Characteristics:**
- Harder to set, easy to measure
- Provides the "what" and accountability
- Enables progress tracking
- Creates clear success criteria

**Why both matter:** Visionary statements provide motivation and direction. Objectives provide accountability and proof of progress. Together they create both inspiration and measurement.

## The Workshop Flow

### Step 1: Start with Vision

**Capture the grand ambition:**
- What's the aspirational future state?
- What motivates the team?
- What's the "why" behind this project?
- Don't worry about exact measurement yet

**Example:**
"Make remote work sustainable and healthy for distributed teams"

### Step 2: Ask "What Will We Observe?"

**Bridge from soft to hard goals:**
- When this vision is being realized, what will we see in the world?
- What measurable evidence proves we're succeeding?
- What observable changes indicate progress?

**This is the critical bridging question** that transforms aspiration into measurable reality.

**Example:**
"When remote work is sustainable and healthy, we'll observe teams using tools daily, staying engaged long-term, and growing their usage. We'll see business metrics that prove the model works."

### Step 3: Define Strategic Objectives

**Transform observations into specific goals:**
- 3-5 concrete objectives
- Each expressed using SMART method (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Focus on what's truly measurable
- Set realistic timeframes

See [SMART Method Reference](../../models/smart-goals-model.md) for detailed guidance on creating strategic objectives.

**Example:**
1. Achieve 5,000 active teams by Q4 2024
2. Increase average session time to 15 minutes daily
3. Reach 70% weekly retention rate
4. Generate $50K MRR by end of year

## Key Questions Saga Asks

### For Vision (Visionary Statements)

- "What's the grand ambition behind this project?"
- "What does 'winning' look like at the highest level?"
- "What vision motivates your team?"
- "Why does this project matter?"

### Bridging to Objectives

- "When this vision is being realized, what will we observe in the world?"
- "What measurable evidence would prove you're succeeding?"
- "What would we see that indicates progress toward this vision?"

### For Strategic Objectives (using SMART method)

- "What specific, measurable outcomes would prove success?"
- "By when do you need to achieve these objectives?"
- "How will you measure progress?"
- "What counts as 'active' or 'successful' in your context?"

## Generic Example Walkthrough

### Vision (Soft Goal)

"Make remote work sustainable and healthy for distributed teams"

**Why this works:**
- Aspirational and motivating
- Clear direction without rigid constraints
- Easy to communicate and remember
- Inspires the team

### Bridging Question

"When remote work is sustainable and healthy, what will we observe?"

**Observations:**

- Growing usage patterns
- Sustainable business model (revenue)

### Strategic Objectives (using SMART method)

1. **Achieve 5,000 active teams by Q4 2024**
   - Specific: Active teams (defined metric)
   - Measurable: 5,000 teams
   - Achievable: Based on market size and growth rate
   - Relevant: Proves market adoption
   - Time-bound: Q4 2024

2. **Increase average session time to 15 minutes daily**
   - Specific: Session time metric
   - Measurable: 15 minutes
   - Achievable: Industry benchmarks
   - Relevant: Indicates engagement
   - Time-bound: Daily measurement

3. **Reach 70% weekly retention rate**
   - Specific: Weekly retention
   - Measurable: 70% rate
   - Achievable: Above industry average
   - Relevant: Proves value delivery
   - Time-bound: Weekly tracking

4. **Generate $50K MRR by end of year**
   - Specific: Monthly recurring revenue
   - Measurable: $50K
   - Achievable: Based on pricing and targets
   - Relevant: Business sustainability
   - Time-bound: End of year

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Skipping the Vision

**Problem:** Jumping straight to metrics without capturing the aspiration  
**Why it fails:** Team loses motivation, no emotional connection  
**Fix:** Start with the grand ambition, then bridge to metrics

### Mistake 2: Vague Objectives

**Problem:** "Improve user experience" or "Get more customers"  
**Why it fails:** Can't measure progress, no accountability  
**Fix:** Make every objective SMART with specific numbers

### Mistake 3: Too Many Objectives

**Problem:** Listing 15 different metrics to track  
**Why it fails:** Dilutes focus, creates confusion  
**Fix:** Limit to 3-5 most critical objectives

### Mistake 4: Unrealistic Targets

**Problem:** "Become #1 in the world in 30 days"  
**Why it fails:** Demoralizes team, loses credibility  
**Fix:** Set challenging but achievable goals based on resources

### Mistake 5: Missing the Bridge

**Problem:** Vision and objectives feel disconnected  
**Why it fails:** Team doesn't see how metrics prove vision  
**Fix:** Use the bridging question to connect them explicitly

## How This Feeds Into Next Workshops

**Workshop 1 creates the foundation:**

```
Business Goals (Vision + Objectives)
    ↓
Workshop 2: Which user groups can help achieve these?
    ↓
Workshop 3: What drives those groups' behavior?
    ↓
Workshop 4: Which groups and drivers matter most?
    ↓
Workshop 5: Which features address top priorities?
```

Everything traces back to the goals you define here.

- ✅ Limit to 3-5 key objectives
- ✅ Reference your Product Brief

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Skip the vision (just list metrics)
- ❌ Accept vague objectives
- ❌ Set unrealistic targets
- ❌ Create too many objectives
- ❌ Forget to connect vision to objectives

## What's Next

Workshop 2 identifies WHO can help you achieve these goals - your target groups. You'll create prioritized personas that become the foundation for understanding user psychology.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Two levels of goals** - Vision (visionary/aspirational) + Strategic Objectives (measurable using SMART method)  
✅ **Bridging question is critical** - "What will we observe when vision is realized?"  
✅ **Strategic objectives using SMART method** - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound  
✅ **3-5 objectives maximum** - Focus on what truly matters  
✅ **Foundation for everything** - All workshops build from here
