# Lesson 5: Workshop 3 - Driving Forces

**Map the Psychology That Drives Behavior**

---

## Overview

Workshop 3 is where you map the psychological drivers for each persona - both what they want to achieve and what they want to avoid. This is the core of understanding what actually drives user behavior.

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Format:** Conversational with Saga  
**Output:** Complete psychological profile for each persona (positive + negative drivers)

---

## What You'll Do

For each persona from Workshop 2, you'll identify two types of drivers:

### Positive Drivers (GAIN)

**What users are moving TOWARD:**
- What do they want to achieve?
- What benefits are they seeking?
- What goals pull them forward?
- What positive outcomes motivate them?

### Negative Drivers (PAIN)

**What users are moving AWAY FROM:**
- What do they want to avoid?
- What frustrations do they experience?
- What fears push them to act?
- What problems are they trying to escape?

**The key insight:** Both matter, but negative drivers often create more urgent action due to loss aversion.

---

## Key Questions Saga Asks

### For Positive Drivers

- "What does this persona want to accomplish?"
- "What positive outcomes are they seeking?"
- "What would make their situation better?"
- "What goals are pulling them forward?"
- "What benefits would they value?"

### For Negative Drivers

- "What problems are they trying to avoid?"
- "What frustrates them about current solutions?"
- "What do they fear will happen if they don't solve this?"
- "What keeps them up at night?"
- "What would be embarrassing or costly?"

### Digging Deeper

- "Why does that matter to them emotionally?"
- "What's the deeper fear behind that frustration?"
- "How intense is this driver on a scale of 1-5?"
- "Is that specific enough, or is it too generic?"

## Generic Example: Remote Team Lead

### Positive Drivers (GAIN)

**What they want to achieve:**

1. **Want to build strong team culture despite distance**
   - Emotional core: Pride in team cohesion
   - Intensity: High (career identity)

   - Intensity: Very high (professional success)

4. **Want team to feel connected and valued**
   - Emotional core: Creating positive environment
   - Intensity: Medium (aspirational)

### Negative Drivers (PAIN)

**What they want to avoid:**

1. **Fear team members burning out without noticing**
   - Emotional core: Guilt and responsibility
   - Intensity: Very high (most urgent)
   - Why powerful: Direct responsibility for people's wellbeing

2. **Fear missing early warning signs of problems**
   - Emotional core: Anxiety about blindness

## Why Negative Drivers Are More Powerful

### The Psychology: Loss Aversion

Research shows people work roughly **twice as hard to avoid pain as to pursue equivalent gain**.

**Generic examples:**

**Scenario 1: Fitness**
- Positive: "Want to look good for summer" → Weak urgency
- Negative: "Fear health problems like parent had" → Strong urgency
- **Which drives action?** The fear

**Scenario 2: Project Management**
- Positive: "Want to be organized" → Nice to have
- Negative: "Fear missing client deadline and losing contract" → Critical need
- **Which drives adoption?** The fear

**Scenario 3: Email Management**
- Positive: "Want clean inbox" → Low urgency
- Negative: "Fear missing urgent client email" → High urgency
- **Which drives behavior change?** The fear

### The Emotional Core

Negative drivers often connect to powerful emotions:

- **Shame:** "What will people think?"
- **Guilt:** "I'm letting people down"
- **Anxiety:** "What if this goes wrong?"
- **Embarrassment:** "This makes me look bad"
- **Fear:** "I could lose something important"

**These emotions drive urgent action.**

## Balancing Both Types

The most powerful understanding comes from mapping BOTH:

### How They Work Together

**Positive drivers suggest:**
- The aspirational features
- Long-term value propositions
- What makes the experience delightful

**Negative drivers suggest:**
- The urgent, must-have features
- What drives initial adoption
- What prevents churn

**Example: Team Pulse Check Feature**

**Addresses positive drivers:**
- Helps build team culture (shows you care)
- Demonstrates leadership (provides data)

**Addresses negative drivers:**
- Prevents burnout blindness (early warning)
- Avoids looking ineffective (proactive management)

**Why it works:** Solves urgent pain AND delivers aspirational benefit.

## Common Patterns Across Contexts

### Pattern 1: Professional Reputation

**Positive:** Want to be seen as competent  
**Negative:** Fear of looking incompetent

**Design implication:** Features that help users look good and avoid embarrassment

### Pattern 2: Time Management

**Positive:** Want to be productive  
**Negative:** Fear of wasting time or missing deadlines

**Design implication:** Time-saving features + deadline protection

### Pattern 3: Social Connection

**Positive:** Want to build relationships  
**Negative:** Fear of isolation or being left out

**Design implication:** Connection features + FOMO prevention

### Pattern 4: Control & Autonomy

**Positive:** Want to feel in control  
**Negative:** Fear of chaos and overwhelm

**Design implication:** Organization tools + anxiety reduction

## What You Get from Workshop 3

✅ **Complete psychological profile** for each persona  
✅ **Both sides of motivation** (gain + pain)  
✅ **Understanding of emotional intensity**  
✅ **Foundation for feature decisions**  
✅ **Insight into urgency** (what drives immediate action)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Only Mapping Positive Drivers

**Problem:** Missing the urgent pain that drives adoption  
**Why it fails:** Don't understand what creates urgency  
**Fix:** Always map both types

### Mistake 2: Generic "Wants" Statements

**Problem:** "Want to be productive"  
**Why it fails:** Too vague to guide design  
**Fix:** Be specific about context and outcomes

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Emotional Intensity

**Problem:** All drivers seem equal  
**Why it fails:** Can't prioritize effectively  
**Fix:** Identify which have strongest emotional pull

### Mistake 4: Listing Features Instead of Psychology

**Problem:** "Want a calendar feature"  
**Why it fails:** That's a solution, not a driver  
**Fix:** "Want to never miss family commitments due to work chaos"

### Mistake 5: Avoiding Negative Drivers

**Problem:** Focusing only on positive because negative feels uncomfortable  
**Why it fails:** Miss the most powerful motivators  
**Fix:** Embrace negative drivers - they're often more actionable

## The Control Question: Validating Your Drivers

Once you've identified the driving forces for each target group, validate them with these critical questions:

### "If This Target Group Feels This Way, Would Our Offering Be the Best Option for Them?"

**What this reveals:**
- Whether your product actually addresses their drivers
- If there's a real fit between their psychology and your solution
- Whether you're solving the right problem

**Example validation:**

**Target Group:** Remote Team Leads  
**Top Driver:** Fear of team burnout without noticing

**Control question:** "If they fear team burnout without noticing, would our daily pulse check be the best option?"

**Validation:**
- ✅ Yes - provides early warning system they lack
- ✅ Addresses the specific fear directly
- ✅ Fits their daily workflow

**If the answer is no or weak:** You may have identified the wrong drivers, or your product doesn't fit this group.

---

### "What Alternatives Do They Have?"

**What this reveals:**
- Competitive landscape from psychological perspective
- Whether your solution is truly differentiated
- What you're really competing against (often not what you think)

**Example analysis:**

**Target Group:** Remote Team Leads  
**Driver:** Fear of team burnout without noticing

**Alternatives they have:**
1. **Manual check-ins** - Time-consuming, inconsistent, relies on people speaking up
2. **Annual surveys** - Too infrequent, backward-looking, no early warning
3. **Gut feeling** - Unreliable, often too late, causes anxiety
4. **Nothing** - Hope for the best, react when crisis hits

**Why our offering is better:**
- Daily automated pulse vs manual effort
- Real-time vs annual
- Data-driven vs gut feeling
- Proactive vs reactive

**If you can't articulate why you're better:** Either the driver isn't strong enough, or your solution doesn't differentiate.

---

### "Why Should They Care in the First Place?"

**What this reveals:**
- Whether the driver has real urgency
- If the pain/gain is significant enough to motivate action
- Whether this is a "nice-to-have" or "must-have"

**Example validation:**

**Target Group:** Remote Team Leads  
**Driver:** Fear of team burnout without noticing

**Why should they care:**
- **Career impact:** Team burnout reflects poorly on their leadership
- **Business impact:** Losing top performers is costly and visible
- **Emotional impact:** Guilt and responsibility for people's wellbeing
- **Immediate consequence:** Can happen without warning, hard to recover from
- **Frequency:** Constant worry, not occasional concern

**Urgency level:** Very high - active fear with career consequences

**If they don't care enough:** The driver may be too weak to motivate product adoption. Look for stronger drivers or different target groups.

---

## Using the Control Questions

### When to Apply Them

**After mapping drivers for each persona:**
1. List all drivers (positive and negative)
2. Apply control questions to top 3-5 drivers
3. Validate fit between drivers and your offering
4. Identify gaps or misalignments

### What to Do with the Answers

**If validation is strong:**
- ✅ Proceed with confidence
- ✅ Use these drivers for prioritization
- ✅ Design features that address them

**If validation is weak:**
- ⚠️ Re-examine the drivers (are they accurate?)
- ⚠️ Consider different target groups
- ⚠️ Adjust your product strategy
- ⚠️ Look for stronger psychological drivers

**If you can't beat alternatives:**
- 🚨 Major red flag - why would they choose you?
- 🚨 Need differentiation or different positioning
- 🚨 May need to pivot target group or offering

### Generic Example: Fitness App

**Target Group:** Busy professionals  
**Driver:** Want to stay healthy despite hectic schedule

**Control questions:**

**1. Would our offering be best option?**
- Our app: 15-minute workouts, no equipment, fits any schedule
- ✅ Yes - specifically designed for time-constrained people

**2. What alternatives do they have?**
- Gym membership (requires travel time, fixed hours)
- YouTube videos (overwhelming choice, no structure)
- Nothing (guilt, declining health)
- Our advantage: Minimal time, structured, no barriers

**3. Why should they care?**
- Health declining, energy low
- Feeling guilty about neglecting fitness
- Want to set good example for kids
- Fear of health problems like parents had
- ✅ Strong urgency - both positive and negative drivers

**Validation:** Strong fit. Proceed with this target group and driver.

## Tips for Success

**DO:**
- ✅ Map both positive AND negative drivers
- ✅ Be specific about context and emotions
- ✅ Identify emotional intensity
- ✅ Dig deeper than surface wants
- ✅ Focus on psychology, not features
- ✅ Apply control questions to validate drivers

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Skip negative drivers
- ❌ Accept generic statements
- ❌ Ignore emotional core
- ❌ List features instead of drivers
- ❌ Treat all drivers as equal
- ❌ Skip validation - assume drivers are correct

---

## What's Next

Workshop 4 prioritizes these drivers - ranking which groups and which psychological drivers matter most. This creates the focus for all design decisions.

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Two types of drivers** - Positive (gain) and Negative (pain)  
✅ **Negative is more powerful** - Loss aversion drives urgent action  
✅ **Map both for each persona** - Complete psychological picture  
✅ **Emotional intensity matters** - Not all drivers are equal  
✅ **Be specific** - Avoid generic wants, find emotional core
