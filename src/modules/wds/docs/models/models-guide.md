# Strategic Design Models

Foundational frameworks from thought leaders that inform WDS methodology.

---

## What This Folder Contains

**Models** are external frameworks created by industry pioneers. These are NOT Whiteport inventions - they're time-tested approaches we've adapted and integrated into our methods.

Each model includes:
- What it is and why it matters
- Full attribution to original creators
- Source materials (books, articles, videos)
- How WDS methods harness it
- Practical examples and applications

---

## Available Models

### [Customer Awareness Cycle](./customer-awareness-cycle.md)

**By:** Eugene Schwartz (1966)  
**Core Idea:** Meet users where they are in their awareness journey (Unaware → Problem Aware → Solution Aware → Product Aware → Most Aware)

**Applied in WDS:**
- Scenario definition (where user starts/ends)
- Content strategy (matching depth to awareness)
- Messaging hierarchy

**When to Use:** Positioning content, defining scenario goals, structuring communication

---

### [Impact/Effect Mapping](./impact-effect-mapping.md)

**By:** Mijo Balic & Ingrid Domingues (inUse), popularized by Gojko Adzic  
**Core Idea:** Visual strategic planning connecting business goals → actors → behavioral impacts → deliverables

**Applied in WDS:**
- Trigger Mapping (Whiteport's enhanced adaptation)
- Value Trigger Chains (lightweight version)
- Strategic alignment from why to what

**When to Use:** Strategic planning, feature prioritization, aligning team on goals

---

### [Golden Circle](./golden-circle.md)

**By:** Simon Sinek (2009)  
**Core Idea:** Inspire action by communicating WHY → HOW → WHAT (inside-out), not outside-in

**Applied in WDS:**
- Product Brief discovery conversations
- Messaging hierarchy and positioning
- Stakeholder alignment
- Content structure

**When to Use:** Defining product purpose, structuring communication, conducting discovery

---

### [SMART Method](./smart-goals-model.md)

**By:** George T. Doran (1981)  
**Core Idea:** A framework for expressing measurable, achievable objectives using five criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

**Applied in WDS:**  
Used in Trigger Mapping Workshop 1 to transform vision (visionary statements) into strategic objectives. Ensures business objectives are measurable and trackable.

**When to use it:** When defining strategic objectives that need to be measurable and actionable.

**Reference:** [SMART Method Reference](smart-goals-model.md)

---

### [Action Mapping](./action-mapping.md)

**By:** Cathy Moore (2008+)  
**Core Idea:** Focus on what people DO (actions), not what they KNOW (information). Design practice, not presentations.

**Applied in WDS:**
- Scenario design (action-oriented)
- Onboarding flows (guided practice)
- Help documentation (task-focused)
- Component specifications (enabling action)

**When to Use:** Designing scenarios, onboarding, help systems, any behavior change context

---

### [Kathy Sierra Badass Users](./kathy-sierra-badass-users.md)

**By:** Kathy Sierra (2000s-2015)  
**Core Idea:** Don't make a better product. Make users better at what they want to do. Focus on user capability.

**Applied in WDS:**
- Component design (making users feel capable)
- Microcopy (building confidence, not just informing)
- Interaction patterns (reducing cognitive load)
- Success/error messaging (celebrating/guiding)

**When to Use:** Any design decision - always ask "Does this make the user feel capable?"

## Models vs. Methods

### Models (This Folder)

**What:** External frameworks from thought leaders  
**Purpose:** Foundational knowledge  
**Attribution:** Full credit to original creators  
**Content:** What it is, why it matters, how to use it  
**Location:** `docs/models/`

### Methods (Method Folder)

**What:** Whiteport's instruments and processes  
**Purpose:** Practical application  
**Attribution:** Derived from models (with credit)  
**Content:** Step-by-step how-to, integration into WDS  
**Location:** `docs/method/`

**Example:**
- **Model:** Impact/Effect Mapping (Adzic/inUse)
- **Method:** Trigger Mapping (Whiteport's adaptation)

## How These Models Work Together

### In Product Discovery

**Golden Circle** → Structure discovery conversations (WHY → HOW → WHAT)  
**Impact/Effect Mapping** → Map strategic connections  
**Customer Awareness** → Position target users

**Result:** Product Brief with purpose, strategy, and positioning

### In Trigger Mapping

**Impact/Effect Mapping** → Core structure (Goals → Users → Impacts)  
**Customer Awareness** → Add awareness positioning  
**Golden Circle** → Understand user's WHY (driving forces)

**Result:** Trigger Map connecting business goals to user psychology

### In Scenario Design

**Action Mapping** → Focus on what users DO  
**Customer Awareness** → Define awareness progression  
**Kathy Sierra** → Make users feel capable

**Result:** Scenarios that change behavior and build confidence

### In Component Design

**Kathy Sierra** → User capability focus  
**Action Mapping** → Enable action, not just display  
**Customer Awareness** → Match content depth to user

**Result:** Components that make users feel awesome
