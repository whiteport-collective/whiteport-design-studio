# Phase 1: Product Exploration

**Agent:** Saga the Analyst  
**Output:** `A-Product-Brief/` (or your configured prefix)

---

## What This Phase Does

Product Exploration establishes your strategic foundation through conversational discovery. Instead of filling out questionnaires, you have a conversation that builds understanding organically.

By the end, you'll have a Product Brief that captures your vision and serves as the north star for your entire project.

---

## What You'll Create

Your Product Brief includes:

- **Executive Summary** - The vision that inspires teams
- **Problem Statement** - The "why" that drives decisions
- **User Types** - The "who" that guides design (initial identification)
- **Solution Approach** - The "how" that enables development
- **Success Criteria** - The "what" that measures progress
- **Market Positioning** - How you're different (optional: ICP framework)
- **Value Trigger Chain (VTC)** - Strategic benchmark created after vision and positioning

**The VTC (Step 4):**

After capturing your vision and positioning, you'll create a [Value Trigger Chain](./value-trigger-chain-guide.md) - a strategic summary that serves as a benchmark for all subsequent discovery work. It captures:

- Business Goal → Solution → User → Driving Forces → Customer Awareness

This early VTC ensures all remaining discovery (business model, success criteria, etc.) aligns with your core strategy. If anything contradicts the VTC during discovery, either the VTC needs refinement or the discovery finding doesn't serve your strategy.

## How It Works

### The Conversational Approach

Traditional requirements gathering treats people like databases - extracting answers through rigid questionnaires. WDS does it differently.

**Instead of:** "Please complete this 47-question requirements document"

**WDS says:** "Tell me about your project in your own words"

People light up when asked to share their vision. They become collaborators, not interrogation subjects.

### The Session Flow

**Opening (5-10 minutes)**

Saga asks about your project in your own words. She listens for:

- What you emphasize naturally
- Where your energy goes
- What excites vs. what stresses you
- Your exact language and terminology

**Exploration (15-30 minutes)**

The conversation adapts to what you reveal:

- If you mention users → deeper into user insights
- If you mention problems → explore the cost of not solving
- If you mention competition → discover differentiation
- If you mention timeline → understand urgency drivers

Each answer reveals the next question. It's jazz, not classical music.

**Synthesis (10-15 minutes)**

Saga reflects back your vision in organized form:

- Connecting dots you shared across topics
- Highlighting insights you might not have seen
- Building the foundation for next phases

### Living Document

As you talk, the Product Brief grows in real-time:

- Immediate validation and refinement
- Real-time course correction
- You own the content because you helped create it
- "Yes, exactly!" moments that build trust

## When to Use This Phase

**Always start here if:**

- Building something new
- Starting a new project
- Need strategic clarity before diving into design

**Skip if:**

- You already have a clear, documented product brief
- Just enhancing an existing feature
- Working on a design system without new product context

---

## What to Prepare

Come ready to share:

- Your project idea (even if rough)
- The problem you're solving
- Who might use it
- Why it matters to you

You don't need polished answers. The conversation will help clarify everything.

---

## What Comes Next

Your Product Brief enables:

- **Phase 2: User Research** - Deeper into user psychology with your strategic context
- **Phase 3: Requirements** - Technical decisions aligned with your vision
- **Phase 4: UX Design** - Design work grounded in strategic purpose

The brief becomes the reference point everyone shares.

---

## Tips for Great Sessions

**Let the conversation flow**

- Share what feels important, even if it seems tangential
- Follow your energy - where you're excited matters

**Think out loud**

- Half-formed thoughts are welcome
- will help you refine them

**Be honest about uncertainty**

- "I'm not sure about X" is useful information
- Better to surface doubts now than later

**Review as you go**

- Check that what's captured matches your thinking
- Correct misunderstandings immediately
