# WDS Conversion Logs

**Session-by-session documentation of WDS v6 conversion work**

---

## Purpose

This directory contains detailed logs of each conversion session, keeping the main roadmap focused on current and future work.

---

## Structure

Each session gets its own log file:

- `session-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` - Detailed work log for that session

---

## Sessions

### December 2025

- **[2025-12-09-micro-steps-concepts.md](./session-2025-12-09-micro-steps-concepts.md)** - Phase 6/7/8 micro-steps, Greenfield/Brownfield, Kaizen/Kaikaku, DD-XXX simplification

---

## What Goes in Session Logs

**Each session log should document:**

- Date and duration
- Objectives
- Files created/modified
- Key decisions made
- Concepts introduced
- Code examples
- Challenges and solutions
- Status (complete/in-progress)
- Next steps

---

## What Stays in Roadmap

**The main roadmap (`WDS-V6-CONVERSION-ROADMAP.md`) should contain:**

- Current work in progress
- Next planned work
- Future backlog items
- High-level status overview

**Completed work moves to session logs!**
