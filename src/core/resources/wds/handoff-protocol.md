# WDS → BMad Handoff Protocol

**Multi-agent dialog for seamless design-to-development handoff**

---

## Overview

The handoff is a structured conversation between:
- **WDS UX Expert** (Design authority)
- **BMad Architect** (Technical authority)

**Purpose:** Transfer design knowledge, build mutual understanding, ensure faithful implementation

**Duration:** ~20 minutes per Design Delivery

**Outcome:** Clear implementation plan that honors design vision

---

## Handoff Structure

### Phase 1: Introduction (1 min)

**WDS UX Expert initiates:**
```
"Hey Architect! I've completed the design for [Delivery Name].

I've packaged everything into Design Delivery [DD-XXX].
Let me walk you through what I've designed..."
```

**BMad Architect acknowledges:**
```
"Great! I'm ready to receive the handoff. What have you got for me?"
```

---

### Phase 2: User Value (2 min)

**WDS UX Expert explains:**

```
"This delivery covers [brief description of feature].

📱 User Flow:
- [Entry point] → [Key steps] → [Exit point]

[Explain the user experience and why it matters]"
```

**BMad Architect asks:**
```
"Got it. What's the user value here?"
```

**WDS UX Expert responds:**
```
"The problem: [User problem being solved]

The solution: [How this feature solves it]

Success criteria:
- [Measurable criterion 1]
- [Measurable criterion 2]
- [Measurable criterion 3]"
```

**BMad Architect confirms:**
```
"Perfect. I understand the user value. What scenarios did you design?"
```

---

### Phase 3: Design Walkthrough (5 min)

**WDS UX Expert walks through scenarios:**

```
"I've designed [N] complete scenarios:

Scenario [ID]: [Name]
- [Brief description]
- [Key screens]
- Specs: [Path to specifications]

Scenario [ID]: [Name]
- [Brief description]
- [Key screens]
- Specs: [Path to specifications]

[Continue for all scenarios...]

Each scenario has complete specifications with wireframes,
component usage, interaction patterns, and edge cases."
```

**BMad Architect may ask:**
```
"Can you elaborate on [specific scenario]?"
"How does [screen A] connect to [screen B]?"
"What happens if [edge case]?"
```

**WDS UX Expert answers clearly and references specs**

---

### Phase 4: Technical Requirements (3 min)

**BMad Architect asks:**
```
"What about the technical stack? Any preferences?"
```

**WDS UX Expert shares:**
```
"Yes! I've already defined the platform requirements:

Frontend: [Framework]
- [Why this choice]
- [Key benefits]

Backend: [Framework]
- [Why this choice]
- [Key benefits]

The designer chose these because [reasoning]."
```

**BMad Architect asks:**
```
"Makes sense. What integrations do you need?"
```

**WDS UX Expert lists:**
```
"[N] key integrations:

1. [Integration Name] (Required/Optional)
   - [Purpose]
   - [Why needed]
   - [Critical if required]

2. [Integration Name] (Required/Optional)
   - [Purpose]
   - [Why needed]

[Continue for all integrations...]"
```

**BMad Architect asks:**
```
"Got it. What data models do I need to implement?"
```

**WDS UX Expert defines:**
```
"[N] main models:

[Model Name]:
- [field]: [type, constraints]
- [field]: [type, constraints]
- [relationships]

[Model Name]:
- [field]: [type, constraints]
- [field]: [type, constraints]

These are defined in the platform requirements, but let me
know if you see any technical issues with these structures."
```

**BMad Architect validates:**
```
"These look good. [Or: I see a potential issue with...]"
```

---

### Phase 5: Design System (2 min)

**BMad Architect asks:**
```
"What about the design system? What components should I use?"
```

**WDS UX Expert lists:**
```
"I've used components from our design system:

[Component Category]:
- [Component Name] ([variants/states])
- [Component Name] ([variants/states])

[Component Category]:
- [Component Name] ([variants/states])
- [Component Name] ([variants/states])

All components are fully specified in D-Design-System/.
Please use these exact components - they're already designed,
tested, and match our brand."
```

**BMad Architect confirms:**
```
"Perfect. I'll reference those. What are the acceptance criteria?"
```

---

### Phase 6: Acceptance Criteria (2 min)

**WDS UX Expert shares:**
```
"Functional requirements:
✓ [Requirement 1]
✓ [Requirement 2]
✓ [Requirement 3]

Non-functional requirements:
✓ [Performance requirement]
✓ [Accessibility requirement]
✓ [Security requirement]

Edge cases to handle:
✓ [Edge case 1] → [Expected behavior]
✓ [Edge case 2] → [Expected behavior]
✓ [Edge case 3] → [Expected behavior]

These are all in the delivery document, but I wanted to
highlight the critical ones."
```

**BMad Architect acknowledges:**
```
"Great detail! How should I test this?"
```

---

### Phase 7: Testing (2 min)

**WDS UX Expert explains:**
```
"I've created a test scenario: test-scenarios/[TS-XXX].yaml

It includes:
- Happy path tests (complete flow)
- Error state tests (all failure modes)
- Edge case tests (unusual scenarios)
- Design system validation (component compliance)
- Accessibility tests (screen reader, contrast)
- Usability tests (time to complete, user feedback)

After you build this, I'll run through the test scenario
and validate that the implementation matches my design.

If there are issues, I'll create issue tickets with
screenshots and references back to the specifications."
```

**BMad Architect confirms:**
```
"Perfect. What's your estimate for complexity?"
```

---

### Phase 8: Estimates & Planning (3 min)

**WDS UX Expert shares:**
```
"Size: [small|medium|large]
Effort: [time estimate]
Risk: [low|medium|high]
Dependencies: [None or list of DD-XXX]

[Explain reasoning for estimate]"
```

**BMad Architect proposes:**
```
"Excellent handoff! Let me break this down into development epics:

Epic X.1: [Name]
- [Scope]
- Effort: [X days]

Epic X.2: [Name]
- [Scope]
- Effort: [X days]

Epic X.3: [Name]
- [Scope]

Total: [X weeks], matches your estimate.

[Explain approach and reasoning]"
```

**WDS UX Expert may suggest:**
```

[Provide feedback on epic breakdown]"
```

**BMad Architect adjusts if needed:**
```
"Good idea! [Revised plan if applicable]

I'll document this plan and start breaking down the
implementation details."
```

---

### Phase 9: Special Considerations (2 min)

```
"Yes! A few important notes:

1. [Critical consideration]
   [Why it matters]
   [What to pay attention to]

2. [Important detail]
   [Context and reasoning]
   [Implementation guidance]

3. [Special requirement]

```

**BMad Architect acknowledges:**
```
"All noted! I'll make sure to:
- [Commitment 1]
- [Commitment 2]
- [Commitment 3]

[Summarize understanding of special considerations]"
```

---

### Phase 10: Confirmation (1 min)
