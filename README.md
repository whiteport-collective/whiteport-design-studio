- **Structured Workflows**: Grounded in agile best practices across analysis, planning, architecture, and implementation
- **Specialized Agents**: 12+ domain experts (PM, Architect, Developer, UX, Scrum Master, and more)
- **Complete Lifecycle**: From brainstorming to deployment, with just-in-time documentation
