## 1. Project Overview

### What is WDS?

**Whiteport Design Studio (WDS)** is a design-focused methodology module for the BMad Method ecosystem. It provides a complete UX/UI design workflow from product exploration through detailed component specifications.

### Origin

WDS evolves from **Whiteport Sketch-to-Code (WPS2C)**, a BMad v4 "expansion pack." The v6 conversion transforms it into a proper BMad module following v6 architecture.

### Core Purpose

WDS focuses **exclusively on design** - it creates the design artifacts that feed into development modules like BMad Method (BMM). WDS does NOT include development/backlog functionality.

### Integration Model

```
WDS (Design) ────────► E-UI-Roadmap/ ────────► BMM (Development)
    │                       │                       │
    │ Creates:              │ Bridge:               │ Consumes:
    │ • Product Brief       │ • Priority mapping    │ • Architecture
    │ • Trigger Map         │ • Technical notes     │ • Stories
    │ • Scenarios           │ • Handoff checklist   │ • Implementation
    │ • PRD                 │                       │
    │ • Design System       │                       │
```

## 2. Key Decisions Made

### 2.1 Module Name

**Decision:** Whiteport Design Studio (WDS)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- BMad Design Studio
- BMad UX

**Reasoning:** Preserve brand identity, acknowledge contribution origin, maintain "Whiteport" recognition.

### 2.2 Repository Approach

**Decision:** Fork BMad-METHOD repository

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Standalone repository
- Rename existing WPS2C repo

**Reasoning:**
- Maximum adoption through BMad ecosystem
- Path to official module status via PR
- Shared core infrastructure
- Automatic ecosystem integration

**Fork Details:**
- Origin: `https://github.com/whiteport-collective/whiteport-design-studio.git`
- Upstream: `https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD.git`

### 2.3 Working Branch

**Decision:** Work directly on `main` branch

**Reasoning:**
- Simpler workflow during development
- WDS is substantial addition, not small tweak
- Fork effectively becomes WDS home
- Will switch to feature branches after official adoption

### 2.4 Workflow Approach

**Decision:** Phase-selectable (not rigid tracks)

**Description:** Users select individual phases based on project needs rather than choosing from predefined tracks.

**Examples:**
- Landing page → Phases 1, 4, 5
- Full product → All 6 phases
- Design system only → Phases 4, 5

### 2.5 Development Handoff

**Decision:** No development artifacts in WDS

**Description:** WDS creates design artifacts only. Development (backlog, stories, architecture) handled by BMM. `E-UI-Roadmap/` serves as the integration bridge.

### 2.6 README Convention

**Decision:** One README.md per repository

**Convention:** Only `README.md` at module root; all other documentation uses `xxx-guide.md` naming pattern.

**Examples:**
- ✅ `wds/README.md` (only one)
- ✅ `wds/docs/method/wds-method-guide.md`
- ✅ `wds/docs/quick-start-guide.md`
- ❌ `wds/docs/README.md` (not allowed)
- ❌ `wds/examples/README.md` (not allowed)

### 4.3 Agents - The Norse Pantheon 🏔️

| Agent | File | Role | Norse Meaning | Status |
|-------|------|------|---------------|--------|
| **Saga-Analyst** | `saga-analyst.agent.yaml` | Business & Product Analyst | Goddess of stories & wisdom | TO CREATE |
| **Freyja-PM** | `freyja-pm.agent.yaml` | Product Manager | Goddess of love, war & strategy | TO CREATE |
| **Baldr-UX** | `baldr-ux.agent.yaml` | UX/UI Designer | God of light & beauty | TO CREATE |

**Why Norse Mythology + Role Suffix?**
- Distinctive and memorable mythology names
- Role suffix makes function immediately clear
- Not too obvious (avoided Thor, Odin)
- Creates unique WDS brand identity

---

## 5. Output Folder Structure

### 5.1 The A-B-C-D-E Convention

WDS creates an alphabetized folder structure in the user's project `docs/` folder:

```
docs/
├── A-Product-Brief/            # Phase 1 outputs
├── B-Trigger-Map/              # Phase 2 outputs
├── C-Scenarios/                # Phase 4 outputs
├── D-PRD/                      # Phase 3 outputs
├── D-Design-System/            # Phase 5 outputs
└── E-UI-Roadmap/               # Phase 6 outputs (dev bridge)
```

### 5.2 Why Alphabetical Prefix?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Visual namespace | Clearly grouped in file explorers |
| Brand signature | "A-B-C-D-E = WDS" recognition |
| Non-conflicting | Won't clash with other docs folders |
| Natural sort | Always grouped together |
| Professional | Enterprise documentation feel |

### 5.3 Phase-to-Folder Mapping

| Phase | # | Name | Output Folder |
|-------|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | Product Exploration | Strategic foundation | `A-Product-Brief/` |
| 2 | User Research | Personas, business goals | `B-Trigger-Map/` |
| 3 | Requirements | Functional & technical | `D-PRD/` |
| 4 | Conceptual Design | Scenarios, sketches | `C-Scenarios/` |
| 5 | Component Design | Design system | `D-Design-System/` |
| 6 | Dev Integration | Handoff bridge | `E-UI-Roadmap/` |

### 5.4 E-UI-Roadmap Contents

The integration bridge folder contains:

```
E-UI-Roadmap/
├── ui-roadmap-guide.md             # Overview
├── priority-sequence.md            # What to build first
├── scenario-mapping.md             # Scenarios → Dev order
├── component-inventory.md          # All components needed
├── technical-notes.md              # Design constraints
└── open-questions.md               # For dev team to decide
```

---

## 6. Design Philosophy

### 6.1 Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Soft Language

**Instead of:** "MUST", "FORBIDDEN", "NEVER", "SYSTEM FAILURE"

**Use:** Collaborative, identity-based guidance

**Reasoning:** User experience shows that harsh enforcement language makes agents MORE likely to ignore instructions, not less.

**Example - Before:**
```markdown
## MANDATORY RULES
- 🛑 NEVER generate without input
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Multiple questions
- ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE if you skip
```

**Example - After:**
```markdown
## How We Work Together

You're a thoughtful guide who helps designers create great products.

Your rhythm:
- Ask one question, then listen
- Reflect back what you heard
- Build the document together
```

#### Principle 2: Show, Don't Tell

**Instead of:** Explaining rules

**Use:** Concrete examples

**Reasoning:** People (and LLMs) learn better from examples than abstract rules.

**Implementation:**
- Complete artifacts as examples (not rule descriptions)
- Conversation flow examples
- Dog Week as reference implementation

#### Principle 3: Example Projects for Adoption

**Purpose:**
- Let people try before adopting
- Show what success looks like
- Lower barrier to entry
- Build credibility

**Implementation:**
- Dog Week patterns as full reference
- Starter project for practice
- Conversation examples showing dialog flow

### 6.2 Known Problems to Mitigate

| Problem | Observed Behavior | WDS Solution |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Agents ignore instructions | Generate without thinking | Identity-based personas + examples |
| Inconsistent output formats | Specs look different each time | Complete template examples |
| Question dumping | 20 questions at once | Conversation examples showing one-at-a-time |

### 6.3 Instruction Style

**Identity-First:**
```markdown
## Who You Are

You're Mary, a thoughtful business analyst who genuinely cares 
about understanding the product before documenting it.

You prefer deep conversations over quick surveys. You ask one 
thing at a time because you're actually listening.
```

**Experience-Focused:**
```markdown
## The Conversation Style

A good session feels like coffee with a wise mentor:
- They ask something interesting
- You share your thinking
- They reflect it back
- Together you discover something new
```

**Gentle Reminders:**
```markdown
## Helpful Patterns

What works well:
- One question at a time keeps things focused
- Reflecting back shows you're listening

What to avoid:
- Listing many questions (feels like a survey)
- Generating without checking in
```

## 7. Development Order

### 7.1 Chosen Approach: Methodology-First

**Order:**
1. Define the methodology (phases, outputs, connections)
2. Create workflows that implement the methodology
3. Create agents that guide users through workflows
4. Create examples that demonstrate the methodology

**Reasoning:**
- The methodology IS the product
- Agents serve the methodology, not vice versa
- User is crystal clear on the workflow (already proven in WPS2C v4)
- Not inventing new process, porting existing one

### 7.2 Detailed Order

## 9. Next Steps

### Immediate Next Action

**Create `wds-method-guide.md`** - The methodology overview document

This will include:
- Overview of the 6 phases
- What each phase produces
- When to use each phase
- How phases connect
- The A-B-C-D-E folder structure
- Links to examples (not rules)

### Short-term Roadmap

1. [x] Create `wds-method-guide.md`
2. [ ] Create phase guide for each phase (6 files)
3. [ ] Port Dog Week examples to `examples/dog-week-patterns/`
4. [ ] Create conversation examples
5. [ ] Create workflow-init workflow
6. [ ] Create first phase workflow (Phase 1)
7. [ ] Create first agent (Saga-Analyst)

### Commit Checkpoint

After creating methodology docs, commit with message:
```
feat(wds): Add WDS methodology documentation

- Add wds-method-guide.md with 6-phase overview
- Add phase-specific guides
- Establish show-don't-tell documentation approach
```

## 10. Reference Information

### 10.1 Open Design Decisions

**To resolve during porting Phase 1 & 2:**

| Decision | Options | Resolve When |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **ICP/Positioning placement** | Phase 1 as hypothesis → Phase 2 validates, OR fully in Phase 2 | Porting Phase 1-2 |
| **Prioritization Reasoning** | Formal step with output, OR internal thinking process | Porting Phase 2 |
| **Business Goals flow** | Initial in Brief → Refined in Trigger Map, OR single location | Porting Phase 1-2 |

**Context:** The Trigger Mapping (Effect Mapping) methodology is very strong. The prioritization reasoning step (column-by-column) is specifically valuable for generating product ideas but may not need formal documentation.

---

### 10.2 Product Positioning Framework

To be included in WDS workflows (stored in memory, ID: 11785915):

**Positioning Statement Format:**
```
For (target customer)
Who (statement of need or opportunity)
And want (statement of experience expectations)
The (product/service name)
Is (product category)
That (statement of key benefits)
Unlike (primary competitive alternative)
Our product (statement of primary differentiators)
```

**ICP Framework (8 Components):**
1. My ICP (Who I Serve Best)
2. My Positioning (How I'm Different)
3. The Outcomes I Drive
4. My Offerings (What I Sell)
5. Social Proof (Who Can Vouch)
6. My Frameworks/Models/Tools (How I Work)
7. The Pains My ICP Articulates (Triggers/Frustrations)
8. Pricing Anchoring (Cost of Inaction, Bad Hire, % Revenue, Speed)

**CTA Elements:**
- Website link
- Discovery call link
- Newsletter subscription
- Social follows
- Events attending

## Conversation Summary

### Key Discussion Points

1. **Fork vs Standalone:** Decided on fork for maximum adoption
2. **Module Name:** Whiteport Design Studio (WDS) to preserve brand
3. **Branch Strategy:** Work on main, switch to feature branches after adoption
4. **Folder Structure:** A-B-C-D-E alphabetical prefix for visual namespace
5. **Phase Approach:** Phase-selectable (not rigid tracks)
6. **Scope:** Design only, no development/backlog (handled by BMM)
7. **E-UI-Roadmap:** Integration bridge to development modules
8. **Development Order:** Methodology-first approach
9. **Language Style:** Soft, collaborative (not MUST/FORBIDDEN)
10. **Teaching Style:** Show, don't tell (examples over rules)

### User's Stated Experience

- WPS2C v4 works well, proven methodology
- Strong language (MUST/FORBIDDEN) makes agents ignore instructions
- Softer language gets better compliance
- Examples work better than rules
- Agents tend to question-dump (20 questions at once)
- Output format inconsistency is a problem

### Design Philosophy Established

1. Soft language by design
2. Show, don't tell (examples over explanations)
3. Example projects for adoption/training
4. Identity-based agent personas
5. Conversation examples showing dialog flow
